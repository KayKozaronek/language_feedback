    "0": "I  (22f) was briefly enrolled in a graduate program this fall, and am still in close contact with a lot of friends I made while I was there.  One of these friends is a 25 year old guy from China.  \n\nBecause English was not his first language and I could tell he was a little isolated, I was careful to be nice and invite him to events.  We started hanging out some on our own, but mostly just to discuss school/world politics; nothing too personal.  He asked me out a few times this fall, and even though I assumed he was single, I turned him down nicely-- just wasn't interested.\n\nAfter the final time I turned him down he got a little clingy and weird, so I tried to create some space between us; I didn't really speak to him over Christmas break.\n\nImagine my surprise when my presumably single friend comes home from China married after Christmas!  Turns out he'd had a girlfriend all along and they tied the knot while he was there.  I assumed that settled things, and went back to occasionally spending time with him.\n\nLast night, he admitted to me that he's jealous of the guy I've been dating and has feelings for me.  I sort of just apologized and ignored it, but now I'm frustrated and not sure what to do.  Normally, I would just cut things off with him since he doesn't seem to be able to have \"just friends\" feelings toward me.  In this case, though, I feel guilty, since he really doesn't have many friends and seems to put a lot of energy into maintaining contact with me.   So what should I do?  Just end things?  Pretend it never happened?  All I know is that I certainly wouldn't want MY husband spending time alone with a woman he had feelings for.  I don't want to cross any lines.",
    "1": "We've been dating for 4 months, but we knew each other for several years prior to dating. Before my boyfriend went to work in the morning we had a quickie, but that left me wanting more. All day yesterday I had been telling him he left my craving more and that I wanted him when he got home at night.\n\nSo the night came, we were cudding on the couch and I made my advance. It should not have come as a surprise because I had been telling him I wanted him all day. I started kissing him and rubbing on him, but I could tell he sort of wasn't into it. I don't know why but I got really frustrated, I stood up and told him \"Fine, I see you don't want to play, so I am just going to leave you alone.\"  I walked away for a few minutes and then I came to sit back down with him. At his point he had his head down and started crying. I felt really bad!\n\nI apologized and we talked. He has told me he is trying to take it slow because in his past relationships he always had a lot of sex and they ended up breaking his heart. He is somehow associating that if he has a lot of sex then the relationship will go sour. He has assured me he wants things to work out for the long haul and is serious about our relationship, I'm just trying to figure out this part.\n\nAnytime he approaches me when he is horny I am glad to satisfy him, but when I approached him last night I felt rebuffed.\n\nDid I overract? Should I try not approching him for a little while, like giving sex a break for a few days? \n\nHe is a very sensitive guy, and I know that already. I want to be considerate of his feelings. Yet at the same time I want him to understand my needs as well.",
    "2": "Okay, so, we met online, and we dated (because we live in the same city). We are together for 7 months, but he isn't my boyfriend. It's kinda weird for me, he is really good and polite and smart, but not romantic at all. We have a lot in common and it's really calming to be in his presence , but there is no passion from his side. He doesn't want sex, he doesn't want me to meet his parents (even though he knows mine).\n\n It's really weird, because he doesn't hide me, I hang out with his friends, but he doesn't want to post anything with me anywhere. I really like him a lot, but it seems like he doesn't want anything serious with me, not even a relationship. \n\nSometimes I have the urge to just tell him that, and every time I start, he says he doesn't want to go fast. But it's been 7 months. Then I end up crying at home and I want to dump him because he's a coward, but I can't because I think I'm in love...",
    "3": "I've had difficulty with distance running due to strong knee pain. My endurance is great, I can cycle for very long distances, but I can't run because my knees give out around 8 to 10 mies.\nI went to the Orthopedist who did a full series of x-rays and pronounced my knees in excellent condition. Then he had me do a bunch of balance exercises and told me that balance and \"hip stability\" was my issue. He prescribed PT, but my insurance is kinda crappy and 3x's/week PT will run me around $300/month. That's a bit steep.\nSo, has anyone else had knee issues due to balance and hip stability? What did you do? Are there balancing exercises I can do at home and not spend a ton of money on PT?",
    "4": "For some background - my parents divorced when I was very young, and from a young age I would stay with my dad every other weekend. When I was about 13 after several incidents I realised what a manipulative person he was and cut ties with him. My Step-Mom died two years ago, and within six months he was engaged to what will be his fourth wife.\n\nHe has made intermittent contact with me over the last few years, and all invitations of contact have been turned down. He asked me to be his Best-Man at his wedding, which I also declined.\n\nCut to today - I got a letter from him asking me for a last time to go to his wedding. I don't know whether or not to go yet. Anyway - he has moved to a new country with his new fianc\u00e9e and as a result is leaving his old car here. He has offered to let me have it, no strings attached, but I would feel hypocritical accepting it. The problem is that I am in desperate need of a car and money is very tight at the moment. It would be so incredible to accept it, but I feel I would be using him.\n\nAny help is very welcome.",
    "5": "Hello all, so the other day I read a post about using MFP to track food and just linking it to a Fitbit so I figured I would give it a shot since everyone loves MFP so much. I've been using my Fitbit with a fair amount of success since February and love it but I end up adding a lot of foods since they aren't in the database.\n\nMy problem is this: I linked MFP with Fitbit for steps and food and only logged my food in MFP like it told me to in 3 different places. I have all the same statistics in both applications including desired weight loss but at the end of the day I had different amounts of calories left. \n\nIn order to lose 1lb/week  Fitbit says I need a 500 Cal deficit so I assume it's the same with MFP but MFP says I have 36 calories remaining and Fitbit says I'm OVER by 110 calories. \n\nI tried checking online first and I can only find people having the opposite problem bc they accidentally log food in both apps but I am 100% sure I did not do that. \n\nHas anyone had this problem? How did you fix it?",
    "6": "6 days ago I was on a gentle bike ride (along a tar road, no hills or anything). We had just reached the point of the ride where we were going to take a 5 minute break, eat some sandwiches and begin the return leg back to our car when I sat down and felt a 'twinge' in my lower back.\n\n I commented to my buddy about the twinge, and then maybe 1 minute later I experienced the most intense pain I have ever felt. It felt like someone had snuck up behind me and thrust a long thin knife into my spine. I collapsed on the ground, with my lower back screaming in pain and my lower body feeling all strange, kinda tingly (more on the right hand side than the left, especially down my right leg). \n\nIt took 2 and a half hours to return to our car (a trip which should have taken 15 minutes). The pain got worse and worse and I could hardly move from it- it felt like a crazy war movie scene with an injured guy begging to be put out of his misery, just trying to push my bike back to the car. My buddy drove me home, where I just managed to unlock my apartment and collapse onto the floor, where I stayed with minor adjustments for the last 5 days. The pain has gradually reduced, but I still feel \"broken\" in my back- If there is weight on my lower back it really hurts. As Im typing this Im holding my weight on my forearms on my desk.\n\nI missed 3 days of work, and am just now back in the office. I scheduled an appointment with a physiotherapist this afternoon, but am not sure what else to do. (This is my first appointment- I could literally not leave the floor for the past 5 days, not even for the toilet, funfun)\n\nIm a relativly heathy guy of 27, have had a history of back problems but *nothing* like what happened to me last week.\n\n Anyone got any ideas of what could have happened, what I should do, or anything else that would help me?",
    "7": "I play a game with my six year old where I give her a topic to research on Google and she writes a basic report or draws it, depending on the subject. We were driving somewhere yesterday and talking about shapes, the difference between a pyramid and a cone, trapezoids, rhombus, pentagons, octagons. She knows all of those, no problem. So I try to make it harder and the only thing I can think of is a dodecahedron.\n\n\"Do you know what a dodecahedron is?\" I asked her. \n\"No. What's a dodeca... wait what did you say?\" she replied.\n\"Do-dec-a-he-dron.\" I repeated this a few times until she got it. \"When we get home I would like you to draw it for me.\" \n\nWe get home, I give her my iPad, write the word down on a piece of paper for her to type into Google, and go into my office to do some work. She gets out her crayons and paper. About 10 minutes later I hear her crying. I walk into her room, there's a couple of crumpled pieces of paper on the floor and she's bawling. \"IT'S THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER DRAWN!!!!\"\n\nI thought it was a simple two-dimensional shape, like an octagon with more sides. I look on the iPad screen and see a twelve-sided, THREE DIMENSIONAL object. Aw fuck, I'm an idiot.",
    "8": "I'm a self taught programmer, never finished college because I'm lazy at school. I don't feel studying back then because I think it won't do me any good with my chosen career (I was taking up library science but really like programming anyway)\n\nNow I'm working as a web developer. And often time I just spend my time playing console games or play league of legends or browse reddit instead of working. I just don't feel working. It's not that I hate work, as a matter of fact I think I have the best boss in the world. The pay is good. All the good things actually. But I dont know why Im lazy.\n\nReddit, how do I get motivated at work?",
    "9": "I'm a junior in college, and is (was?) really good friends with this girl for coming on two years now. For the past... almost 11 months at this point I suppose, we've been hooking up but remaining friends in a pretty weird situation. Well, I discovered she had feelings for me, and found that as I was coming into my junior year I had developed the same for her. It seemed like somehow we were actually going to avoid a messy friends-with-benefits falling out of sorts.\n\nAnyways, she and I ended up having an open conversation about the possibility of dating. We decided that there was some stuff I had to take care of first, but we were both into the idea and agreed to be platonic friends until we would (really inevitably at this point) start dating.\n\nAnd then, a few days after that conversation, I got really, way too drunk and made out with one of our mutual friends. Hoo boy. While this mutual friend and I talked and agreed it was a stupid mistake that we didn't want to repeat, my friend (rightfully so) became very hurt. She went home for the weekend and we stopped talking, but she came back basically saying that she didn't want to cut me out of her life, but that I had really broken her trust, I would have to build that back up, and that our friendship would never really be the same.\n\nHonestly, I deserve all of it - even though it really was a stupid mistake and I would never in my right mind intend to do something like this, the fact is that I did it anyways while drunk and really did fuck up.\n\nI don't know that there's much to do from here - while I'd really still like to date this friend, I can definitely see why that possibility could be off the table forever now. I guess at this point I'd just like to know if anyone has any advice for what to do from here; I'd like to prove to her that I do really care about her and build that trust back up. I really do feel awful about this all. Anyone been in a situation like this? What did you do/what did you learn from it?",
    "10": "anyway, here goes. Over the past few months, and with increasing regularity, I've been receiving prank calls on my cell phone. Always from a different number, and from area codes all over the U.S., but every call comes from some smart-ass adult, saying they were from some Automotive group, or something of the sort. At first they sounded completely legit, but then they'd ask to speak with Bob. Since I'm not Bob, I'd tell them there's no one here named Bob, you have the wrong number. They would repeat my number back to me, and say they wanted to speak to Bob Zurncle. (Bob's Your Uncle, just in case you missed it) Needless to say, this has become increasingly annoying, especially since the caller is going through a lot of trouble, spoofing fake area codes, and always using this horribly stereotypical fake Hindi accent. Today I received another one of these calls and I'd had enough. I answered, and right away they asked for Bob's Ur Uncle, and I snapped, started cussing a streak, yelling, asking why they didn't have anything better to do with their life, when I hear a woman on the line, saying please sir, let me explain. Our records show that you filled out an online request for an auto insurance quote back in January, and you submitted it with, what is now obviously fake name Bob Zuruncle, but apparently you used your real phone number, hence the calls. \n\nJibber's Crabpst, I do stupid well.",
    "11": "Someone just sent a bulk email to all the members who didn't pay dues in our student organization. They listed each of the member's names, along with how much they exactly owed in the body of the email.\n\nTo me, it seems like this is a big violation of privacy (thought that he should have used a BCC instead), but I wanted Reddit's opinion to see if I wasn't overreacting? He's a bit of a control freak, so I'm not sure if that's part of it or if it's me overreacting as well (or maybe a bit of both).\n\nDepending on what you guys think, I was thinking of sending him an email saying that this is something that he shouldn't have done and how he should BCC everyone's emails instead.\n\nThanks!",
    "12": "Bear with me here, there is a bit of a story. \n\nSo I am a part time manager at my movie theater job (one step above staff member), My general manager has a \"managers can't even be friends with staff\" rule which I frequently ignore. In my opinion he has no say over what I do when I'm not at work as long as it's not effecting my job performance. \n\nThe other day I was working as the only Manager on duty and I spent a lot of the day talking to this one guy, we'll call him Joe. Joe and I often talk a lot on shifts but never really about anything personal, more like latest movies, what we did on the weekend etc. \n\nAt the end of his shift I brought Joe into the office to balance his cash drawer and he waited until we were in there alone and said out of no where \"Do you want to see deliver us from evil\"\n\nI didn't think anything of it and responded by saying \"I do want to see it, I like scary movies but none of my friends will ever watch them with me.\"\n\nTo which he responded \"because I kind of want to see it...\" At that point someone else knocked on the door and we weren't alone in the office anymore so that was it. \n\nNow he's away on a family trip for the next 2 and a half weeks. \n\nWas he trying to ask me if I wanted to see that movie with him? or was he just making small talk?",
    "13": "I graduated in 2013 with a BA in Political Science. When I started college I thought I wanted to go to law school, but I realized that I only wanted to attend law school for my parents. Then I thought I'd want to pursue a career in international relations or something like that, but I just didn't want to go into more debt with more school. About a year after I graduated, I started to work as a substitute teacher, so I figured I'd pursue teaching. While getting into an alt cert program, I started working at Ross (the store) in October of 2014. While at Ross, I had so much pressure on me to find a teaching job with health insurance. Fast-forward to August 2015, I finally got a teaching job! But that job was hell on earth. I suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, so after two months, I had to quit. I went to a therapist (which I'm still seeing) and I'm doing much better, so now I have a job at Sears.\n\nI'm thankful for my job, but I'm 25 going to be 26 in May and I'm still living with my parents. I've been trying to save money, but I have a $450 monthly bill that I have to pay for that alt cert program. Luckily, May will be the last month I have to pay on that. I've been trying to apply to teach English abroad, but I just got rejected by EPIK, so I don't think that's going to work out.\n\nI just don't want to work in retail anymore. I'm not saying that retail is all bad, but I just want something a little more. But now I feel like this is all I can do right now. I'm starting to feel like I'm only qualified for retail. No other area will hire me. I've been looking for jobs out of state (I live in Louisiana), but I can't afford to move out yet (despite me desperately wanting to). I just feel like a failure who doesn't know what to do.",
    "14": "I'm not sure how this will go, so please bare with me.\n\nMy parents are separating after 20something years. They have always had issues, never got married and haven't slept in the same room/bed for 16 years. \n\nThey have said a couple times over the past 15ish years that they were going to separate, but never did. Just empty words. But now my mom has a date to move and is asking me and my sister to \"pick sides.\" \n\nMy boyfriend and I have been having issues since he got kicked out of his house 3 weeks ago and has been living with my family since then. However, he should be moving back home this week. But that extra strain has been exhausting.\n\nBesides all of this, I have severe anxiety and depression. I receive \"disability support\" through my university, but all it really does is allow me to take my tests in a separate room. I also have concentration issues and just passed a screening for ADD. \n\nOn top of all this my piece of shit laptop has broken down for the 4th time in less than 2 years. I have a 5 page paper due tomorrow that I haven't started due to all of the above factors. I feel like school isn't for me, and I'm not going to pass this semester, putting me on academic probation.\n\nI just feel like everything around me is crumbling with little control over it all.\nI just needed to talk to somebody because I'm currently in my car in my school's parking lot crying like a little bitch.",
    "15": "Alright, so I'm F25 and he's M27ish.\n\nSo one of my best friends and I met at a summer camp when we were both in primary school. She had a brother a couple years older, and the three of us would go on adventures across the neighborhood and wreak havoc in local playgrounds everywhere. Once high school started, my friend and I started drifting apart. Her family was incredibly religious and mine was becoming increasingly liberal in the changing political climate. Although our families remained friends throughout it all, I can't help but feel her parents seeing us as a bad influence. Although we lived down the street from each other, my friend and her brother were sent to private Christian schools for the rest of their education, giving me fewer reasons to see her or her brother.\n\nYears pass, my friend's brother moves out of state for college, and she follows suite after she's done with high school, and I don't really hear from them until four years later when he moves back home and I decide to solicit his help on a website I wanted to make. I felt like we really bonded over this. He was really cool and incredibly helpful, funny, and smart to boot! Although he went to a private schools, he's very open-minded about civil rights issues, we have similar political affiliations, watch the same TV shows, and he isn't ashamed to like musicals.\n\nMy main problem is that I've had a history of horrible relationships. Not even horrible in the way most people think. I feel like there's a very strong chance I'm asexual. I've been in four big relationships that I felt helped me become the person I am today, and I'm thankful for it, but they all ended with the fact that I was unwilling to have sex with my partner.\n\nI feel a sense of security with him, because I know he would never do anything outside of my comfort zone. However I don't start a lot of relationships because I feel guilty about not being able to satisfy my partners. One of my biggest concerns is that if he does wind up liking me back, and we start dating, and something happens causing us to break up, this could mean bad things for our family's already fragile relationship.\n\nOKSO",
    "16": "Some background: I'm 22, f, 5'4\" and currently around 253 lbs. Over the last 3 weeks I've cut out soda and sweet tea completely, started eating more fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and less white bread, reduced my calorie intake (down to 1390) started doing cardio at the gym (3 mph on the treadmill at an incline of 1, for about an hour, every day). Thanks to this, I've lost 15 lbs from my starting weight of 268.\n\nNow, I'd like to start strength training so that I'm not only losing fat but maintaining/building muscle so that when I finally do lose all this weight I won't just be a nasty, wrinkly mass of skin. I plan on strength training 3 times a week. \n\nWhile at the gym earlier today (last night?), I wrote a list of weight machines I should use and I just wanted to get peoples' opinions on my routine and if there are any other machines I should use or any muscle groups I neglected in selecting the machines. \n\nBEFORE anyone says I shouldn't use weight machines, I'd just like to say I'd prefer them because I'm uncomfortable using free weights and that's just that. When I'm more confident in my ability to keep form while lifting, I'll go to free weights, until then, I'd like to know that I'm not going to drop anything on myself or peel my muscles from my bones (I'm quite attached to them, you know!) because I didn't do something right.\n\nAnyways, here's my list of machines:\nLeg press\nHip abduction/adduction\nLower back (that's all the machine said)\nCompound row\nVertical chest press\nPullover\nOverhead",
    "17": "Hi All,\n\nFor most of my life I've been slated to give my brother a kidney. We've always joked about it and never really thought of it too seriously, but now that day is close. \n\nI'm not a particularly fast runner or an expert by any means. I've ran a marathon, I'm training to run a faster marathon and I plan[ned] to do my first ultra this spring.\n\nHowever, I don't know if any of this is doable with one kidney. I don't even know if doing a full marathon is possible. I spoke to my primary about it (she's not a specialist on the matter) and I'll meet with a nephrologist in a couple of months for an expert opinion. \n\nI'm feeling kind of lost. Running has become a part of my life and has made me a better human being. It isn't something I want to give up and I selfishly wish this donor thing could be put off for another 5 years so I can attempt my pipe dream goal of a 100mi ultra. \n\nI'm just wondering if there are any one kidney runners here to give me hope and inspiration for years to come.",
    "18": "I am the legal guardian of my cousin [10/M]. We were both abused by my uncle/his father, who is currently in prison far away from us, and his mother signed over her rights to me. I've been Cousin's guardian for two years now, and we're doing well.\n\nRecently, our grandmother (uncle's mother) has tried to get into contact with us again. I cut off a huge swathe of my family during the trial \u2013 essentially everyone who was not explicitly on our side \u2013 and my grandmother was part of that. Grandmother wants to make amends for her \"ambivalence,\" and that she is not talking to my uncle.\n\nCousin loves Grandmother and was upset when I cut contact with her, even when I explained the situation, and I want to do right by him. But I do not trust her at all. If my uncle even finds out a smidge of information about Cousin, I will not be responsible for my actions. We do not live in a state with grandparent visitation rights, so I am not worried about legal repercussions, but I don't know how to approach anyone on that side of the family.",

Her father her sister, and herself all come down to visit for 3-4 weeks every summer.\n\n2. Her father is slightly over protective. On a scale from 1 to 10 I'd say 5.\n\n3.

    "20": "This FU happened in December of last year, so forgive me, and is possibly one of my worst.\n\nSo my very closest friend in the world (let's call him AssHat) loves to troll me. I, in turn, enjoy trolling him back. Recently, he received a dare to post something serious to his facebook as part of a prank. The way the prank works is that if somebody messages you about the serious thing you posted, you are given something by them to post on your wall. The joke spreads around like that, and is sort of stupid in my opinion. A few days later, I see he has posted to his wall \"My Grandmother went to heaven today.\" With the odd wording, and me hearing nothing of his grandma's ill health, I assumed it was another one of his prank posts to lure more people in to his silly joke. I thought it would be rather funny to mess with some of the believers in the comments of the post.\n\nI type \"Good riddance\" into the comments and, within seconds, I receive a reply from one of his friends I did not know saying \"That's horrible. Why would you say something like that?\" With a lack of better judgement, I decide not to hold back. I go on a rant spreading lies about his grandmother: \"She was a horrible person and a menace to society\", \"She even ran over my cat and never apologized\", \"I went to AssHat's house and saw alot of German WWII related items.\", \"That monster was literally a nazi!\", \"She's scum of the earth and we're better off without her.\"\n\nI felt pretty accomplished with my trolling, not even considering the possibilty his grandmother could have actually died. Later that night, I returned to facebook only to see my comments had been deleted, and AssHat's comment about the awful things I had said. Turns out his Grandmother had actually died that day, and I was the worst best friend in the world. I of course apologized profusely, and attempted to explain myself, but he was still ticked at me for a couple of days.",
    "21": "First time on here. I (m28) with my girlfriend (f28) for 10yrs+. We broke up for about a year a couple of years back (1 kid at this stage) obviously both went off on the single scene.\n\nWe got back together and had another kid together. Recently I found out she was with a guy that she worked with years ago. They had been \"friends\" and texting each other on and off over the years. But when  we weren't together she ended up sleeping with this guy. He had a girlfriend at the time, think he still does.\n\nI recently confronted my partner about this and she told me that she didn't see any harm in texting him when we were together originally because \"nothing happened\". I'm finding it hard to believe that a guy would keep interest after 8 yrs (when they originally met) if he wasn't getting anywhere (unless they were just friends)\n\nUsually if this was one of my friends in this situation, I'd say fuck her. But the problem is we have 2 children and I can't bear the thought of not seeing them everyday. Or them growing up in a broken home.\n\nI don't know whether to believe what she is telling me or what to do. I can't think properly about the whole situation, I'm lost! \n\nTo make it worse, I found out where the guy lives and the temptention to fuck him up is going through my head. Have thought about finding his girlfriend and telling her. (They have been in a longterm relationship aswell as far as I know)\n\nSorry if this read seems a bit all over the place but I've never had to do anything like this before.

    "22": "My BF found a great job in the south and we have been living down here for 4 months now. I like it okay, but I have been feeling really sad about missing out on being with my family and friends (and dogs!). This job has the potential to be a long running career for him and although the company does have multiple locations in multiple states I'm not sure they will ever be in the state my family is in. Which is a problem for me. \n\nI'm very much in love with him, and can see us getting married someday however I feel as though I'm at a crossroads, where if I commit to him its commiting to a life without my loved ones. And I have a really close relationship with my whole family. I knew I was moving to be with him but I didn't want it to be a long term commitment. I brought it up with him and he agreed that he isn't including me in his future plans but didn't seem to want to alter them. \n\nBefore we moved, it was loosely agreed that we would stay down here for a few years, he would chip away at his student loans while I either went back to school or found a job and saved up. Which sounded fine, but as of late he's been talking a lot about staying for the next 5 or even 10 years. And I'm not sure that's going to change....",
    "23": "23 m\n\nI'm not socially awkward, but I am fairly introverted. It's not that I don't like to talk, I just don't usually talk unless I have something to say. That aside, women never talk to me first nor can they keep a conversation going. Even in group discussions in class, usually only the guys will discuss the topic with me. \n\nHere's the bizarre thing, I have a TON of gay friends that hit on me all the time. Why are the men so forward and confident, but women are all shy or uncomfortable / anxious around me? Tbh, I have the same amount of close gay friends as I have close straight guy friends. And obviously that ratio is pretty lopsided. And literally only women that I'm not very attracted to will try to be friends with me and they're always way cooler than most above average looking women(from my perspective). It's like there's some kind of tension there when I'm around attractive women. I don't know if it's what I say, or if I put off bad vibes, but it's usually only around attractive women. It's like even if I'm actually trying to hold a conversation, they don't contribute.\n\nMy luck has been bad enough to where I had sexual relations one time with my only best female friend and she has avoided hanging out with me ever since. I'm not sure what the problem was because we were pretty close. She didn't even give anything a chance, but I suspect this had to do with her relatively recent breakup.\n\nEvery women I've been with or been \"talking\" has said I'm too attractive for them. Idk if that's even related, but it's like they think they aren't good enough for me when I try to become more than friends. Sometimes I think how much easier it'd be if I was gay lol. Gay guys always find me one way or another, it happens all the time ha.\n\nAlso, my field of study has an inherent lack of women. That probably has a lot to do with the lack of women in my life in general. \n\nSo, what could the problem be??",
    "24": "Hi Reddit, I need your help!\n\nJust a few weeks ago I met this guy(m/23) and we had this 'click' right from the start. I was at a small party and I met him there. I was the youngest, I knew, everyone called me a 'jailbait' so I knew everyone was at least 1 or 2 years older than me.\n\nI had come there because a good girl friend of mine(f/20) asked me to come, and said it would be fun. I didn't want to go at first, but she begged me to, so I thought I'd just go to make her happy.\n\nThe guy I met and I talked for hours straight. When the party was over and I was back home again, we continued whatsapping, facebooking and skyping for hours nonstop. We have so much in common - we say the same things at the same time, we feel the same way about basically everything!\n\nNow, I have two problems here. First one is, that the girl that wanted me to come to the party, is a lesbian, I never thought anything of it - but apparently she's fallen in love with me. She is one of my closest friends. How do I politely tell her that I'm not going to date her? She's pushing me into it, I've been with a girl once for 4 months or so, but she knows that I'm not into girls anymore, but I guess she thinks she can force me into becoming a lesbian. At least, that's what it feels like.\n\nSecond, I really like the guy. I found out he was 23 later because he was ashamed of his age at first. We didn't really mention it at first because we just didn't think about it - we all knew I'm a 'jailbait' and I knew he had to be at least 18 or older, apparently our age difference is 6 years. I'm stressing over it. \n\nFor Valentines day he's going to take me out. I'm really excited for it and if we have the same click again, I think we will become a couple. Just... How do I tell my mom?",

I was probably the only one there who didn't go with someone. I don't know.\n\n  Well, a little about myself. For starters, I'm gay. Most of my friends know lol. I'm really into (old) music. Goth, Punk, Deathrock, 80's indie/ jangle pop. I also like some non- alternative music, mostly old school. Some days, l look like l attended a Victorian funeral. Other days, l look like a cross dressing burlesque performer out of Tim Burton's mind. l also have a kick ass mohawk lol. Last l checked, it was almost 9 inches tall. But enough about me.\n\n  Back to the problem. I feel no likes me. Well, no one has shown any interest. Maybe l'm being impatient? I don't know. I guess l feel unattractive. Unwanted, perhaps? I also don't know if l want to meet someone through the internet (although l wouldn't be opposed to it). I'm not really sure how l should go about things.\n\n  I guess l haven't approached the right people? I mean, l can strike up a conversation with anyone. I have reasonably good social skills. Maybe no one will approach me? Not sure. I'm not trying to complain or anything. I just wanna put it out there. I'm sure there's something l'm not doing right.\n\n  I need input, at the very least. Perhaps a step in another direction that l haven't considered. There's not much else l can think of. I don't know if l should wait or what. I could end up waiting forever.

I asked him one night after we both drank a lot if he went to go see her and he said no. I'm pretty sure he lied about it, and I've been going back and forth for months about whether or not to ask him while we're both sober.

    "27": "It rained!!! (Guess where I'm from) I got my drivers permit about 2 months ago, bought a car two weeks later with my hard earned money from the summer. The car was shitty to others but a full blown race car to me. Looked like crap but ran like a champ. Anyways, I have never driven in the rain so I knew I'll run into trouble on my way back home from work. Hydro planing sounded familiar to me but never knew it's real consequences. Coming up to my turn where for a good mile (in Dominic torretto voice) I'm free. On the turn there was a huge size puddle of water. I tried to avoid it completly but knew and figured that the front right tire will hit the water. Remember that word \"hydroplane\", yeah I fucked up. The left front tire went over then sunk, causing me the turn into the side of the road. Closer to the edge, the water is deeper. My engine choked, I'm really fucked. Knew trying to keep turning the key will only make things worst. I got out, in ankle deep water, had the bitch in neutral and pushed to the corner of the turn. On the bright side of this whole predicament, a trucker got out of his rig and helped me push the water logged car to the edge. Once out of the water, I tried to give life to my racecar. Once she turned back on I booked it home. Ran the same as before except for a knocking noise. The noise just hurts thinking about it. From the advice from other gearheads, it can't be easy to fix or safe to use without causing more damage. Already made a craigslist ad to at least get some money for another one. F you \"EL NINO\"",

Ever since we've met she has been like this, but for some reason I'm only just recently realizing that she might be one of the greater reasons I have no real friends. (She also has no real friends... Basically all we have is each other and our boyfriends. But that's it.)\n\nMy thoughts on this are that since she is always talking shit about everyone, other people over the years must think that I am like that too.

The house was rebuilt brand new within the past few years, and we knew we just had to have it when we saw it. The process has been relatively painless up to this point, including the resolution of several things from the home inspection process.\n\nFast forward to yesterday: law office sends over a correspondence letting us know that one of the sellers has died, but the remaining spouse still intends to move forward with the sale. Instant remorse and sorrow set in; despite hardly knowing the person. Then my wife brings up a valid point: what if the person died in the house? Will we still be comfortable to move forward ourselves, given that knowledge? I dismissed this, figuring hey the sellers are young, it probably was an accident of some sort (not trying to sound insensitive here, just trying to get my point across).\n\nI spoke to our lawyer last night, and basically was told that we are in a binding contract, and (barring a homicide or wrongful death in the house of sorts) would need to move forward so long as the seller wishes to move forward. Outside of this, we would need to involve a litigator, and that will create a huge headache I an sure.\n\nNow, we just found out that the seller did indeed die in the house (suddenly).\n\nI don't know how to feel or what to think. Maybe we're overreacting? My wife is more disturbed over the situation then I am, but I still feel unrest. Any and all advice or constructive criticism is welcome. Are we right to feel this way?

Ever since he hasn't been ANYWHERE near it, he doesn't want to even go outside anymore near that area (he'll just go potty & come right back inside).  I have tried carrying him over there and just holding him walking towards it, but right when I put him down he runs for his life back home.

I'm not sure. \n\nI am currently training for my first half- and full-marathons, in Chicago this September and October. I have been running consistently for the last few months. Maybe not as much as I should, but running 8 miles at 80 minutes was no problem and something I did a few times per week. I had a 14 miler that had some walking, and many shorter ones. \n\nTwo weeks ago I left to do some traveling. I packed my gear and intended to do some serious running while away. But I was quickly frustrated because I couldn't seem to run more than 2 miles without losing all steam. At first I thought I just had a bad day. But it's been two weeks now, and not once have I managed three straight miles. \n\nThese are all my guesses: \n\n1. Switched time of day that I run: I was running late mornings, early afternoons. During my trip, I had to shift to the early mornings. I figure this was needed anyway, since the half and full marathons are morning runs. \n\n2. Change of bed? \n3. Stress due to travel? This was all in the northern midwest, though, so I wasn't grappling with significant climate or elevation changes. \n4. Change of diet? I had been eating fairly lean before, but then was wiped out by a hard run for days at a time. A friend told me I should be eating a lot more. I increased my diet, and my running plummeted. \n5. Reduction in alcohol consumption. Yeah, this one is weird. I was drinking too much and cut way back, down to nothing for a week (which is a long time for me). Energy plummeted a few days later. \n\nAny thoughts? Anyone have a similar experience? Should I be worried?",

He said he regretted it pretty early on but they continued to be together for two months, and not once did he try to contact me to work things out. \n\nIt was short lived, apparently, and he's back saying he fucked up and he realized his mistakes and \"realized\" that what we have is a once in a lifetime sort of thing.

I have allowed him to remain on my cell phone provider's family plan (for free) as well as utilize one of my checking accounts to pay some of his bills with the small amount of money he has to his name.\n\nTonight I found out that he has overdrawn on the checking account, so I am going to close that tomorrow. I have also since switched cell phone carriers to be on my wife's family plan (to save money), so the cell service is going to be cancelled tomorrow as well, seeing as it is only burning a hole in my fiscal pocket.\n\nI can talk with him until I'm blue in the face. I can take responsible action concerning my end of things. But there seems to be nothing to motivate him. He has had ample time to go out and get a job. He was a big rig driver (all of those jobs he squandered), now he could at least go out and get a menial job just for the income, but he doesn't. He's exhausted his retirement, fails to drawn on his pension (because he believes that he can't 'yet', so he doesn't try...either way I think it is small and he only gets half because of a divorce settlement), and he's in the process of losing his house and everything he owns.\n\nAfter I close the accounts tomorrow, what do I do?!",

I hop in the shower to enjoy the jazzy tunes (because, who doesn't like to sing in the shower) and I don't bother to close the bathroom door because I'm home alone right? Getting out to dry off when my favorite, \"When your good to Mama\" is on. \nFor those of you who don't know *Chicago* very well, \"When you're good to Mama\" is very sudctive if sang/danced right. So I feel hot when I sing this song and began to dry off in a senutal mannor, I put my leg up on the closed toilet seat and having a little sexy time in the mirror to see what I look like if I ever get a boyfriend and I do my little number when I turn my head to see-...\nMy Uncle, starting down the hallway.

It may not be a lot for some of you more experienced college kids/ working men/women, but for me i was swamped.\n\nHere is a list of the work i had to do:\n\n1. A 10 page term paper that was required to include 10 sources (2 of which from actual books and not the internet) in APA style format. \n\n2. A 2 week nutrition diary that i had to include times of day and the calories that each item had, which of course i completely bullshitted.\n\n3. A 6 page research paper of our choice with 10 sources MLA style\n\n4. (Because I'm studying exercise science) A Detailed workout regiment of at least 3 times per week that i have done and what affect they have plus the duration/rep count/intensity/sets.\n\n5. Practice and conditioning for baseball - trust me this does eat up a lot of god damn time, plus the time it takes to get ready, get to the field, and to shower afterwards.\n\n6. Actually going to class - I'm going to throw this in there because it did eat up a good portion of the time i could have been working on the work mentioned above.\n\nAgain, this may not sound like a lot, but each of these activities were very time consuming and it took many energy drinks, a sleepless night,  and a damn good amount of motivation to complete aka not getting on Reddit. Also i had to turn down all my friends that wanted to hang out. Btw this was over the span of 2 days because it's a mix of my Monday-Wednesday-Friday classes and my Tuesday-Thursday classes.",

I should clarify that it's never excessive, violent, or directed at me. I kind of admire his assertiveness sometimes. A lot of people would probably see this as a reasonable level of emotion, but I have some problems dealing with it.\n\nAs I mentioned, I (24) am a doormat. I very, very rarely get angry at anything. My usual response to conflict is to curl up into a ball and cry. I was also physically abused by my father as a kid, because of his anger management issues. When other people are angry, I feel awkward and terrified. I'm working with a therapist to try to get over some of my emotional problems. So far I can successfully deal with anger from/get angry at my sister and my best friend without it being a big deal. With other people, any form of conflict just sits in my mind and scares me.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been dating for 8 months. He knows all about my issues, accepts them, and is always very kind and collected when we're working out minor problems together. But he still gets very angry at other people, and himself. We have similar interests, and I feel more comfortable talking to him than to anyone else. Our relative anger levels just seem incompatible.\n\n I've talked to him about how people getting angry scares me, and he's very understanding of that. I know it's not right to want someone in a relationship to change. I know that's part of who he is and I admire it a bit, but I don't really want to have to become agressive to accept it either. Most of all, I'm terrified of either one of us becoming angry with each other. I know it probably has to happen eventually, and I don't want to get scared and end the relationship.",

I'm new to the whole dating game and wondering a few things. \n\nDo I need to ask if we're together as bf/gf or is that implied by asking her out multiple times? Should I straight up ask if she likes me the way I like her? I know what the friend zone is and I'm not feeling there, yet, but we're having a movie night tomorrow just her and I. I plan on seeing what's what then by trying to get physical, not hardcore, just simple stuff like leg touches, cuddling etc. Oh and finally, to add to my lengthy situation, On our third \"date\" (studying for an exam) I drove her home and attempted to kiss her but got the infamous cheek. I didn't make a big deal about it I just moved past said \"got your things?\" and politely said goodbye preceding to wait for her to get inside her house. I've been told I shouldn't fret about ONE kiss rejection cause there could be multiple reasons for it but at the same time that made me think more about the friend zone possibility. \n\nAny advice or similar situations and how you solved the problem would be smashing!

I don't want to continue craving it, so do you have any suggestions for addressing this problem?

    "50": "Hi.  First off, I've already made an appointment with a lawyer but I figured as much information as possible couldnt hurt.\n\nIn february, I rear-ended a car after skidding on water.  The car accident was pretty minimal honestly (my airbags didn't deploy/car function fine/only cosmetic damage).  A cop was called and took accounts and photos.  The guy seemed irritated but not hurt in the least.  I gave him/the police my insurance and contact information.  As far as I knew he took care of it and I hadn't heard from him.\n\nApparently, the cop miswrote my cell number (making a 1 look like a 7) and the guy had been trying to contact me.  I found out my insurance policy that had been in effect was cancelled due to lack of payment (I was on my parents insurance and I was unaware they hadn't paid/they did not inform me).  I got my own insurance asap but I found out I was basically boned because I technically didn't have insurance during the time the accident occurred.\n\nThis morning I received a manila envelope on my car windshield addressed to me.  In it, the guy wrote me a letter describing his attempts to contact me.  Additionally, he included a large amount of my information he could find online (facebook photos, employee page, white pages info, etc.).  He also included the incident report and two quotes for repairs to his damages.  He's seeking me to pay him in a cash order for the full repair of his car or he will seek more, including damages for \"whiplash and a concussion\" although as far as I can tell he has no proof of either.  Basically, what is my best option here.\n\nAlso, while I know he had active insurance, am I responsible for the full amount or for whatever the deductible would be?",

But I could only see our mutual friends. And I thought it was weird. And then I noticed that his profile was pretty much the only one where I could not see a complete friends list, so I'm thinking he's got privacy filters set. \n\nNow, I KNOW he updates his filters regularly (a long while back we were having some relationship issues, and I was blocked from seeing most of his profile for a brief period of time), and he has coworkers on his friends list and screens his posts from some of them. \n\nThe thing is, I don't think I'm an overly clingy girlfriend (and he has said numerous times that I'm not). I don't try to control every aspect of his life. So I'm not sure why I no longer have full access. \n\nI'm concerned because he's had a habit in the past of poor communication (which he has attempted to work on). But he does tend to close off, and if he DID have something he wanted to keep from me, this seems like one of the ways he might attempt to do so.\n\nIs it acceptable to ask if it was just an oversight or if it was intentional? Is there a good WAY to ask? Is it possible/likely that it is just a mistake? Or is it possible he has something to hide? I'm not going to fly off the handle; it's just that his track record has been such that this could be nothing, or it could be SUPER HUGE, and I won't know until it's too late.",

I had a surgery last spring, fell into a depression, ate literally nothing but junk food for a year, and gained half of my lost weight back. \n\n30 days ago, I got fed up with myself and decided to get my shit together. I dusted off my MFP account and my kitchen scale, started logging everything I ate, and haven't touched fast food or soda since. \n\nNow, one thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I am a dialysis patient. I got a rare autoimmune disease when I was 19 and almost died. I had to drop out of university and move back across the country to live with my parents. Lots of crazy shit has happened since then, and I will be on dialysis for the rest of my life. Part of managing this is going to doctor appointments in the local peritoneal dialysis clinic every three months. They do bloodwork, you meet with a dietician, you meet with a pharmacist, they check blood pressures and things, and you meet with a doctor. Takes about three hours. \n\nMy bloodwork has traditionally been shitty. My phosphorus, calcium, potassium levels have been all over the place. I was on 10 pills a day to manage my calcium alone. \n\nNow, on to the actual point of this post. \n\nAt my clinic appointment yesterday, I was informed that ALL of my bloodwork fell in the normal range. \n\nALL of it. \n\nI've been taken off more than 50% of my medications because I don't need them anymore. \n\nThe dietician/nutritionist (is there a difference? i don't know) was astonished.

I now live in more accepting city, but I can never be to sure. \n\nAny input or advice you might have on the situation is greatly appreciated.\nThanks!",

I have always been nice to her and supported her in the things she has done.  \n\nMy friend, let's call her Blake, and I used to text everyday from the beginning of freshmen year of high school until our first semester in college.  When I say everyday I honestly mean everyday.  We would talk about a large range of topics (class to very personal stuff).  Then, on some random day, she stopped replying to me and has never contacted me again.  I have wished her happy holidays, birthday, etc and nothing.  Really I just want opinions on why this may be.  I guess I just miss having that really close friend that I could talk to about anything.",
    "68": "Hello Reddit. The problem in the title has been presented to me recently and I don't know how to approach it. Last August I was desperately looking for an apartment before college started and settled on moving in with two friends, who were a couple. Here's a breakdown I'll try to keep as unbiased as possible.\n\n* We each paid $367.\n* The girl in the couple was preggers at the time.\n* I did not physically sign the lease because I had no means of transportation at the time. I sent them the money and they signed it. \n* The lease was for August through the end of April.\n* I stayed until January. An individual apartment that I had originally wanted and applied for way before I took the apartment with my friends opened and I took they opportunity because 1) They said they were fine with it and 2) They needed room for the baby\n* During my stay, the girl had a job some of the time, I had a job the entire time, and the guy didn't have a job because he played baseball at the university.\n*Also during my stay I paid for cable/internet to be installed and paid all of the cable/internet bills. They were ~$100/month. They paid for utilities (~$50 or less/month) and did give me some food from time to time. (They had food stamps). \n* I told them when I moved out if they need help, to ask me.\n* Found out today when checking about the deposit, they claim they had to pay $400 to clean the apartment (which was already pretty spiffy, just a few carpet stains), $100 for cleaning supplies, and the guy had to sell his car to make ends meet. \n\nWhat do I do in this situation? I'm in a bind where I need my money back. I also don't want to be a dick and make them pay me back. I don't know what to do.",

He emails me and begs me to reconsider and give him a real shot one day. That he will wait for me. I'm not sure how to make myself more clear. He says he needs to talk to me and get closure. That he has things he needs to say to me that he's kept bottled up for the last few months and needs to get off his chest. I told him that he wouldn't find the closure he needs by talking to me.

I apologize if this post is kind of all over the place, but trying to quick explain the situation. \n\nMy FH and I are both military (LDR for 4 years) and stationed at different bases.  We have been talking marriage for over a year, planning on doing a simple backyard ceremony within the next year or two.  Fast forward to recent times, and he has gotten overseas orders, leaving in fall of this year.  I am unable to go with him unless we are married.  \n\nTo top it all off, I was recently deployed for 6 months, and at the end of my deployment, my FH deployed to a different area.  By the time he gets back (late spring) it will have been a year since we've seen each other. \n\nAnyway, after discussion, we have decided to get married before he goes overseas.  Then, either I can try to apply to get orders with him, or I will be eligible to go be with him after my contract is up next year. \n\nHe is coming to visit me after he gets back from his deployment, and we have been discussing doing a court house marriage at that time.  The problem with this, is that both of our families would not be able to make it at that time (both his dad and my grandma are dealing with serious illnesses at this time).  We do not want to disappoint our families by getting married without them, but we absolutely cannot wait on the marriage due to the military. \n\nSo now for the advice....would we be terrible people for eloping/doing a court house wedding by ourselves....but only announcing engagement to everyone at that time?  We would plan to do a backyard wedding in fall before he leaves so that our families would have time to plan and be there.  Would 3-4 months be enough time to plan a simple backyard ceremony/reception?  Anybody have experience with either elopment or backyard weddings?",

She bailed on going out on the Friday as she'd been out the night before but said she'd definitely see me this week.\n\nSo I asked her tuesday if she wanted to do something Wednesday and she again said maybe as she thought she already had plans with her friend. She then text me late yesterday afternoon to say she's busy.\n\nSo I went out with my best friend who works with her and he got the impression that she doesn't want to go out with me. She said she's going away to study abroad for a year in a few weeks and thinks I've forgotten and doesn't really want to get into a relationship. She had mentioned both of these things the night I got with her but she'd also said she didn't like one night stands so I have no idea what I was.\n\nHonestly I just can't quite understand why you'd say your up for going out with someone then do everything you can to avoid it.

My Dad works nights a lot so he regularly takes the laptop with him, so I just assumed he would visit the sites then.

The problem is that I'll have to miss my sister-in-law's wedding because it falls right in the middle of the week we're planning to go, and it wouldn't make sense to leave early or go late.

    "90": "I'm asking for my girlfriend... struggling to find the appropriate place. \n43, F, 5'0\", 170lbs, White (Non Latino), 10 yrs, abdominal, previous cysts & hysterectomy, no current meds\n\nAround 10 years ago, she had surgery to remove a cyst (I forget what it's called, but she explained it as basically a fetus that ends up growing as a cyst - we weren't together then, so that's the best I can do). This was performed at a rural hospital, and poorly apparently. They told her that during the surgery, they accidentally nicked an artery or vein, and had trouble stopping the bleeding. The surgeon at the time told her that she had to use very large sutures, and following, she had bleeding for at least a couple weeks. Ever since then, she has had irregular bowel movements - in that, she is often constipated for days. Presently, she does show some signs of potential gall bladder issues, but the symptoms in question predate this by years. She has been dealing with abdominal pain and constipation since the surgery. I am wondering if it's possible that this surgical mishap could have cut off some blood flow to the intestines or some other part of the excretory system resulting in the symptoms... but researching this has been difficult. I understand medical terms, but my searches have mostly turned up home remedies for constipation. She has taken stool softener to minor effect, and magnesium citrate to almost no effect. Any ideas are appreciated.\n\nThere is a long history as to why she hasn't pursued the matter previously, but it's beyond the scope of the issue at hand.",
    "91": "My little girl was born 7 1/2 weeks early (which was also six weeks past the age cutoff for our school district).\n\nAfter two weeks in the nicu and a month on heart/lung monitors at home, she completely caught up and surpassed pretty much every growth metric for actual age (forget about adjusted!).\nNow, at 4 1/2 she's reading books designed for late first-grade and doing late-kindergarten math, mostly just on her own volition.\n\nWe've been terrified for a while of her having to wait an entire year for her to start kindergarten because she'd probably end up a huge discipline problem and start-off her entire school experience on a terrible foot.\n\nAfter months of looking, we finally found a private school willing to bend the rules for her and that we can afford.  Once she's through kindergarten, she'll be set for public school and we're off from there.\n\nSo, aside from my huge sigh of relief, I desperately want to give her something on her first day of kindergarten to show her how proud and hopelessly attached to her I am.\n\nBut, I'm drawing a blank.  I've thought about jewelry, but what can I find that would withstand a kid that young and be something she'd want to keep as she gets older?\n\nHelp me, reddit!  You're my only hope.",
    "92": "My boyfriend asked me today how many guys I've slept with in the past. I know that I am the more experienced of the two of us and I really don't want to tell him. I think he's slept with two women and while I love him and love the sex we have, he isn't as great as previous partners and I'm afraid he'll start to compare himself. I've had about five partners, seven if we're not just counting actual penetration. They've all been in serious relationships and one a marriage. I don't feel like this makes me a whore but I'm afraid he will view it that way. I feel like this is a normal number for a guy but maybe a little high for a woman? Should I just lie?",
    "93": "I invited this girl to a theme park with me. Things got a bit strange there, as we held hands together and she grabbed me and hugged me on a couple of rides. After the theme park she goes, \"omg thanks for the best theme park trip ever <3 :).\" The next day she asked me to go to some youth thing her church is having. I said sure and she went on and on about how \"this meant a whole lot to her\" and how \"we're gonna have a great time :).\" I thought it was gonna be fun too, but at the actual thing she left me alone to my own devices, with total strangers (I wasn't sure about going for THIS EXACT REASON.) The next day was worse... She brought another guy with her and not only did she ignore me and ditch me again, she started getting all touchy-feely with this guy. Gee, I can see how much my presence means to her... I know we aren't actually dating yet or anything but man, that sucked big time to see her like that. I am contemplating not going anymore (its a week-long event) but the discussions and \"sermons\" are actually enlightening and to not go would basically ignore the teachings of said sermons - but I don't know if I really would enjoy seeing her like this and what effect it will have on my feelings in the long run (so far I feel hurt and neglected...)",
    "94": "Hey guys I need some serious advice on something, my girlfriend of 6 months is losing her sex drive big time, and its really putting a damper on our relationship.\n\nWe both have talked about it numerous times but at the end of the day I can't shake the feeling that whenever we do it (1-2 times a week) its only because she knows I'll be upset if we don't.\n\nIt never used to be this way when we first started dating, and then she went on BC, which we have both discussed as a possible reason for the decline in her sex drive, but she doesn't want to go off of it and she doesn't seem to mind the lack of sex. \n\nWhat truly bothers me about all of it is that I genuinely feel like she doesn't even enjoy it anymore, and therefore the sex itself is sucking, a lot.  \n\nAll I wanna know is if laying off of initiating, (which lately has been every time were alone in my room, and getting denied like 40-50% of the time) will help, or if she will merely see it as a relief and be content with rarely ever having sex anymore. help reddit!",
    "95": "My boyfriend and I have a great relationship. We don't live together but we live in the same city and see each other often.\n\nHe's just got his dream job in the US and once the visa is sorted will be moving there. He says he will stay for 2 years or so and then come back to be with me. He also says he's dedicated to me and that he won't let the distance ruin our relationship.\n\nWhile I believe truly that he means these things, I've been roughed up around the edges before about loves lost and have a failed long-distance relationship in my past.  I am having a huge amount of trouble accepting that our relationship can last.  He says my negativity is getting him down about it, and that if anything will ruin it, it will be my wet blanket.\n\nRedditors, can it work? Please share some positive helpful stories about long-distance that's really turned out for the best. I hear so much that goes wrong, and have had bad experiences. I need to channel a better outlook about this!",
    "96": "Hey folks,\n\nMy ex (we dated for just shy of 3 years) and I broke up about 6 months ago, and I was immature about it. Neither of us were happy in the relationship, but I told her I didn't want to be friendly going forward and basically never wanted to see or hear from her again. This is complicated by the fact that we live in the same neighborhood, went to college together and share some common acquaintances.\n\nEven though breaking up was very hard on me, I also stupidly followed through on a macho impulse to act as though it didn't particularly bother me at the time and, when she asked me how I was so calm, told her that it just felt better now that we had made a decision.\n\nSo, I think this adds up to me having been a jackass. And I really regret it because I have no end of respect for this woman. I've thought on and off about reaching out to apologize because it seems like the right thing to do, but I don't want to weird her out now 6 months out from breaking up.\n\n I have no desire to get back together with her, nor do I think she'd be interested in dating me again. However, I'd love for us to be on decent terms and feel like I probably messed that up. \n\nWhat do you all think? Better late than never or better never than late for this kind of thing?",
    "97": "So my gf and I have, for the most part, been doing great. We've said the \"i love you\"s and have awesome times together.\n\nMy main problem is that she is very independent and it leaves me feeling uncared for. For example, today we had lunch plans. I texted her a reminder and she said she already ate because she was hungry but that i could meet her at the library to hang out a bit. I feel fed up because many times she has set up a date only to cancel it or change it without seeming to think of me. \n\nI believe she isnt doing it purposefully and is just self focused. Still, i feel like im constantly stressed about our relationship and cant get a good read on what she is feeling. I want to get through to her but when i try to talk about our relarionship i just feel like im spoiling the mood. My question is: should i just accept this as part of her? Or is it worth fighting about? I consistently feel neglected but i know she loves me. Maybe im just too emotionally dependent.",
    "98": "So this hapened literally yesterday so as I sit here on the toilet typing this I remember it like it was yesterday.\n\nSo in English we are reading a book and I was not paying very much attention. I was zoned out for a bit and when I zoned back in the first thing I heard was the phrase,\" Why did she tell her father she was a prostitue,' and the inner twelve year old in me blurted out,\" Family Discount?\" \n\nNow keep in mind that I said this very quietly and carefully so only my peers heard it. But them my dumb ass of a friend decided it was to funny to not repeat so he yelled for the whole class to hear,\" Family discount.\" Then of course the teacher heard. So when my friend was confronted by the teacher he told her that I was the one who originally said it like the dumb ass he is. Needless to say both of us have detention for a week and I am grounded from my computer for a month.",
    "99": "I've known this girl, I myself am 20 and she is 19, for quite some time now and we became friends very quickly. I've only recently begun to develop feelings for her, but it's been quite obvious to me for some time that she has had and now shares those feelings. I've really been trying to hide my feelings though because she; however, is in what her family, friends, and I call a terrible relationship. \n\nShe no longer has any guy friends left because they were all scared off by this guy and she's trying her hardest to keep the fact that she's been talking to and hanging out with me on the regular a secret because she's afraid that he'll harass me or try and hurt me. \n\nHer sister and I are also starting to get concerned that the relationship  might become physically abusive. I would like to specify that at this point it is only to the, best of my and her families knowledge, a verbally argumentative relationship, but she's told me it's been getting worse recently. And they have been dating for 6 months.\n\nI've never really been one to ask for advice, but I don't know if I should continue being passive and deal with the problems as they come or if I should just put myself out there? I'm just afraid if I do that I'll risk pushing her away and losing someone I consider to be my best friend. \n\nThat's my conflict, I just want to know what you think and if I should do anything at all, I know this is a rather small bit of information to go on so any advice at all would be helpful.\n\nThanks"

One of these friends is a 25 year old guy from China.  \n\nBecause English was not his first language and I could tell he was a little isolated, I was careful to be nice and invite him to events.  We started hanging out some on our own, but mostly just to discuss school/world politics; nothing too personal.  He asked me out a few times this fall, and even though I assumed he was single, I turned him down nicely-- just wasn't interested.\n\nAfter the final time I turned him down he got a little clingy and weird, so I tried to create some space between us; I didn't really speak to him over Christmas break.\n\nImagine my surprise when my presumably single friend comes home from China married after Christmas!  Turns out he'd had a girlfriend all along and they tied the knot while he was there.  I assumed that settled things, and went back to occasionally spending time with him.\n\nLast night, he admitted to me that he's jealous of the guy I've been dating and has feelings for me.  I sort of just apologized and ignored it, but now I'm frustrated and not sure what to do.  Normally, I would just cut things off with him since he doesn't seem to be able to have \"just friends\" feelings toward me.  In this case, though, I feel guilty, since he really doesn't have many friends and seems to put a lot of energy into maintaining contact with me.   So what should I do?  Just end things?  Pretend it never happened?  All I know is that I certainly wouldn't want MY husband spending time alone with a woman he had feelings for.  I don't want to cross any lines.\n\nSummary: My friend from school who is now married is still in love with me and I don't know what to do about it.\n\nFeedback: This summary is good overall, it should however mention that her friend from graduate school does not have many friends and that she feels guilty for trying to cut things off. Also her friend puts a lot of energy in maintaining contact with the author. The summary should also convey that the author is asking for advice on what to do about this. \n\nTL;DR",

He rebuffed my advances.\n\nText: We've been dating for 4 months, but we knew each other for several years prior to dating. Before my boyfriend went to work in the morning we had a quickie, but that left me wanting more. All day yesterday I had been telling him he left my craving more and that I wanted him when he got home at night.\n\nSo the night came, we were cudding on the couch and I made my advance. It should not have come as a surprise because I had been telling him I wanted him all day. I started kissing him and rubbing on him, but I could tell he sort of wasn't into it. I don't know why but I got really frustrated, I stood up and told him \"Fine, I see you don't want to play, so I am just going to leave you alone.\"  I walked away for a few minutes and then I came to sit back down with him. At his point he had his head down and started crying. I felt really bad!\n\nI apologized and we talked. He has told me he is trying to take it slow because in his past relationships he always had a lot of sex and they ended up breaking his heart. He is somehow associating that if he has a lot of sex then the relationship will go sour. He has assured me he wants things to work out for the long haul and is serious about our relationship, I'm just trying to figure out this part.\n\nAnytime he approaches me when he is horny I am glad to satisfy him, but when I approached him last night I felt rebuffed.\n\nDid I overract? Should I try not approching him for a little while, like giving sex a break for a few days? \n\nHe is a very sensitive guy, and I know that already. I want to be considerate of his feelings. Yet at the same time I want him to understand my needs as well.\n\nSummary: A woman discusses her frustration with her boyfriend who rebuffed her advances. She is trying to figure out how to handle the situation so that both her and her boyfriends needs are met.\n\nFeedback: This summary is good, it should however point out that the boyfriend is trying to take things slow because he had bad experiences where previous relationships went sour when they had lots of sex in the beginning. The author is also wondering if she overreacted and if she should give sex a break for a few days.\n\nTL;DR",

We are together for 7 months, but he isn't my boyfriend. It's kinda weird for me, he is really good and polite and smart, but not romantic at all. We have a lot in common and it's really calming to be in his presence , but there is no passion from his side. He doesn't want sex, he doesn't want me to meet his parents (even though he knows mine).\n\n It's really weird, because he doesn't hide me, I hang out with his friends, but he doesn't want to post anything with me anywhere. I really like him a lot, but it seems like he doesn't want anything serious with me, not even a relationship. \n\nSometimes I have the urge to just tell him that, and every time I start, he says he doesn't want to go fast. But it's been 7 months. Then I end up crying at home and I want to dump him because he's a coward, but I can't because I think I'm in love...\n\nSummary: Girl (F/19) doesn't know what to do with guy (M/21) who is good and polite, but not romantic and doesn't want anything serious.\n\nFeedback: The summary should make clear that the girl is already together with the guy for 7 months. The summary should also point out that the guy is not passionate and doesn't want sex.

Then he had me do a bunch of balance exercises and told me that balance and \"hip stability\" was my issue. He prescribed PT, but my insurance is kinda crappy and 3x's/week PT will run me around $300/month. That's a bit steep.\nSo, has anyone else had knee issues due to balance and hip stability? What did you do? Are there balancing exercises I can do at home and not spend a ton of money on PT?\n\nSummary: Knee pain due to poor balance \u2013 Orthopedist says balance is the issue, prescribed PT.

When I was about 13 after several incidents I realised what a manipulative person he was and cut ties with him. My Step-Mom died two years ago, and within six months he was engaged to what will be his fourth wife.\n\nHe has made intermittent contact with me over the last few years, and all invitations of contact have been turned down. He asked me to be his Best-Man at his wedding, which I also declined.\n\nCut to today - I got a letter from him asking me for a last time to go to his wedding. I don't know whether or not to go yet. Anyway - he has moved to a new country with his new fianc\u00e9e and as a result is leaving his old car here. He has offered to let me have it, no strings attached, but I would feel hypocritical accepting it. The problem is that I am in desperate need of a car and money is very tight at the moment.

I've been using my Fitbit with a fair amount of success since February and love it but I end up adding a lot of foods since they aren't in the database.\n\nMy problem is this: I linked MFP with Fitbit for steps and food and only logged my food in MFP like it told me to in 3 different places. I have all the same statistics in both applications including desired weight loss but at the end of the day I had different amounts of calories left. \n\nIn order to lose 1lb/week  Fitbit says I need a 500 Cal deficit so I assume it's the same with MFP but MFP says I have 36 calories remaining and Fitbit says I'm OVER by 110 calories. \n\nI tried checking online first and I can only find people having the opposite problem bc they accidentally log food in both apps but I am 100% sure I did not do that. \n\nHas anyone had this problem? How did you fix it?\n\nSummary: Fitbit and MFP are not communicating properly and giving different results.\n\nFeedback: The summary lacks details, concretely the summary should mention that the calory count differs on Fitbit and MFP after logging food with the MFP.

We had just reached the point of the ride where we were going to take a 5 minute break, eat some sandwiches and begin the return leg back to our car when I sat down and felt a 'twinge' in my lower back.\n\n I commented to my buddy about the twinge, and then maybe 1 minute later I experienced the most intense pain I have ever felt. It felt like someone had snuck up behind me and thrust a long thin knife into my spine. I collapsed on the ground, with my lower back screaming in pain and my lower body feeling all strange, kinda tingly (more on the right hand side than the left, especially down my right leg). \n\nIt took 2 and a half hours to return to our car (a trip which should have taken 15 minutes). The pain got worse and worse and I could hardly move from it- it felt like a crazy war movie scene with an injured guy begging to be put out of his misery, just trying to push my bike back to the car. My buddy drove me home, where I just managed to unlock my apartment and collapse onto the floor, where I stayed with minor adjustments for the last 5 days. The pain has gradually reduced, but I still feel \"broken\" in my back- If there is weight on my lower back it really hurts. As Im typing this Im holding my weight on my forearms on my desk.\n\nI missed 3 days of work, and am just now back in the office. I scheduled an appointment with a physiotherapist this afternoon, but am not sure what else to do. (This is my first appointment- I could literally not leave the floor for the past 5 days, not even for the toilet, funfun)\n\nIm a relativly heathy guy of 27, have had a history of back problems but *nothing* like what happened to me last week.\n\n Anyone got any ideas of what could have happened, what I should do, or anything else that would help me?\n\nSummary: Sudden, intense back pain while on a bike ride leads to days of incapacitating pain. Seeking help from a physiotherapist.\n\nFeedback: This summary is good. It should also mention that the author had a tingly feeling in his legs and a history of back problems. Lastly the summary should mention that the author is aksing for ideas on what could have happened and what they should do.\n\nTL;DR",

We were driving somewhere yesterday and talking about shapes, the difference between a pyramid and a cone, trapezoids, rhombus, pentagons, octagons. She knows all of those, no problem. So I try to make it harder and the only thing I can think of is a dodecahedron.\n\n\"Do you know what a dodecahedron is?\" I asked her. \n\"No. What's a dodeca... wait what did you say?\" she replied.\n\"Do-dec-a-he-dron.\" I repeated this a few times until she got it. \"When we get home I would like you to draw it for me.\" \n\nWe get home, I give her my iPad, write the word down on a piece of paper for her to type into Google, and go into my office to do some work. She gets out her crayons and paper. About 10 minutes later I hear her crying. I walk into her room, there's a couple of crumpled pieces of paper on the floor and she's bawling. \"IT'S THE HARDEST THING I'VE EVER DRAWN!!!!\"\n\nI thought it was a simple two-dimensional shape, like an octagon with more sides. I look on the iPad screen and see a twelve-sided, THREE DIMENSIONAL object. Aw fuck, I'm an idiot.\n\nSummary: Tried to show off to my six year old by asking her what a dodecahedron is and she drew one for me, now I feel like an idiot.\n\nFeedback: This summary is wrong and completely misses the point of the post. The father did not try to show off to his six year old, but played a game where the goal for his daughter is to draw a geometrical shape. The summary should mention that the author did not know that a dodecahedron is a three dimensional twelve-sided object and that the daughter started crying because she couldn't draw it as it was way too complicated.\n\nTL;DR",

Openly talked about dating, then I did something pretty bad.\n\nText: I'm a junior in college, and is (was?) really good friends with this girl for coming on two years now. For the past... almost 11 months at this point I suppose, we've been hooking up but remaining friends in a pretty weird situation. Well, I discovered she had feelings for me, and found that as I was coming into my junior year I had developed the same for her. It seemed like somehow we were actually going to avoid a messy friends-with-benefits falling out of sorts.\n\nAnyways, she and I ended up having an open conversation about the possibility of dating. We decided that there was some stuff I had to take care of first, but we were both into the idea and agreed to be platonic friends until we would (really inevitably at this point) start dating.\n\nAnd then, a few days after that conversation, I got really, way too drunk and made out with one of our mutual friends. Hoo boy. While this mutual friend and I talked and agreed it was a stupid mistake that we didn't want to repeat, my friend (rightfully so) became very hurt. She went home for the weekend and we stopped talking, but she came back basically saying that she didn't want to cut me out of her life, but that I had really broken her trust, I would have to build that back up, and that our friendship would never really be the same.\n\nHonestly, I deserve all of it - even though it really was a stupid mistake and I would never in my right mind intend to do something like this, the fact is that I did it anyways while drunk and really did fuck up.\n\nI don't know that there's much to do from here - while I'd really still like to date this friend, I can definitely see why that possibility could be off the table forever now. I guess at this point I'd just like to know if anyone has any advice for what to do from here; I'd like to prove to her that I do really care about her and build that trust back up. I really do feel awful about this all. Anyone been in a situation like this? What did you do/what did you learn from it?\n\nSummary: Junior in college, had been hooking up with a friend for about 11 months, but we decided to start dating. I got drunk and made out with another friend, hurting my original friend's trust. What should I do now?\n\nFeedback: This summary is really great. The only thing that should be added is the fact that the author acknowledges that he deserves all of it and that he is asking if anybody else has been in such a situation. \n\nTL;DR",

Over the past few months, and with increasing regularity, I've been receiving prank calls on my cell phone. Always from a different number, and from area codes all over the U.S., but every call comes from some smart-ass adult, saying they were from some Automotive group, or something of the sort. At first they sounded completely legit, but then they'd ask to speak with Bob. Since I'm not Bob, I'd tell them there's no one here named Bob, you have the wrong number. They would repeat my number back to me, and say they wanted to speak to Bob Zurncle. (Bob's Your Uncle, just in case you missed it) Needless to say, this has become increasingly annoying, especially since the caller is going through a lot of trouble, spoofing fake area codes, and always using this horribly stereotypical fake Hindi accent. Today I received another one of these calls and I'd had enough. I answered, and right away they asked for Bob's Ur Uncle, and I snapped, started cussing a streak, yelling, asking why they didn't have anything better to do with their life, when I hear a woman on the line, saying please sir, let me explain. Our records show that you filled out an online request for an auto insurance quote back in January, and you submitted it with, what is now obviously fake name Bob Zuruncle, but apparently you used your real phone number, hence the calls. \n\nJibber's Crabpst, I do stupid well.\n\nSummary: I got prank called because I filled out an online form with a fake name, but used my real phone number.\n\nFeedback: This summary is ok but should mention more details.

When I started college I thought I wanted to go to law school, but I realized that I only wanted to attend law school for my parents. Then I thought I'd want to pursue a career in international relations or something like that, but I just didn't want to go into more debt with more school. About a year after I graduated, I started to work as a substitute teacher, so I figured I'd pursue teaching. While getting into an alt cert program, I started working at Ross (the store) in October of 2014. While at Ross, I had so much pressure on me to find a teaching job with health insurance. Fast-forward to August 2015, I finally got a teaching job! But that job was hell on earth. I suffered from anxiety and panic attacks, so after two months, I had to quit. I went to a therapist (which I'm still seeing) and I'm doing much better, so now I have a job at Sears.\n\nI'm thankful for my job, but I'm 25 going to be 26 in May and I'm still living with my parents. I've been trying to save money, but I have a $450 monthly bill that I have to pay for that alt cert program. Luckily, May will be the last month I have to pay on that. I've been trying to apply to teach English abroad, but I just got rejected by EPIK, so I don't think that's going to work out.\n\nI just don't want to work in retail anymore. I'm not saying that retail is all bad, but I just want something a little more. But now I feel like this is all I can do right now. I'm starting to feel like I'm only qualified for retail. No other area will hire me. I've been looking for jobs out of state (I live in Louisiana), but I can't afford to move out yet (despite me desperately wanting to).

Could this work?\n\nText: Alright, so I'm F25 and he's M27ish.\n\nSo one of my best friends and I met at a summer camp when we were both in primary school. She had a brother a couple years older, and the three of us would go on adventures across the neighborhood and wreak havoc in local playgrounds everywhere. Once high school started, my friend and I started drifting apart. Her family was incredibly religious and mine was becoming increasingly liberal in the changing political climate. Although our families remained friends throughout it all, I can't help but feel her parents seeing us as a bad influence. Although we lived down the street from each other, my friend and her brother were sent to private Christian schools for the rest of their education, giving me fewer reasons to see her or her brother.\n\nYears pass, my friend's brother moves out of state for college, and she follows suite after she's done with high school, and I don't really hear from them until four years later when he moves back home and I decide to solicit his help on a website I wanted to make. I felt like we really bonded over this. He was really cool and incredibly helpful, funny, and smart to boot! Although he went to a private schools, he's very open-minded about civil rights issues, we have similar political affiliations, watch the same TV shows, and he isn't ashamed to like musicals.\n\nMy main problem is that I've had a history of horrible relationships. Not even horrible in the way most people think. I feel like there's a very strong chance I'm asexual. I've been in four big relationships that I felt helped me become the person I am today, and I'm thankful for it, but they all ended with the fact that I was unwilling to have sex with my partner.\n\nI feel a sense of security with him, because I know he would never do anything outside of my comfort zone. However I don't start a lot of relationships because I feel guilty about not being able to satisfy my partners. One of my biggest concerns is that if he does wind up liking me back, and we start dating, and something happens causing us to break up, this could mean bad things for our family's already fragile relationship.\n\nOKSO\n\nSummary: childhood friend moves back home, re-connects, and wonders if dating would work\n\nFeedback: This summary is really bad and does not convey the important parts of the text. The summary should mention that the author wonders if dating an old childhood friend that she re-connected with is a good idea. The summary should also point out that the friends family is very religious and hers is liberal and she wonders if a break up with this friend would lead to bad things for the already fragile relatnionship between the families.

Over the last 3 weeks I've cut out soda and sweet tea completely, started eating more fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and less white bread, reduced my calorie intake (down to 1390) started doing cardio at the gym (3 mph on the treadmill at an incline of 1, for about an hour, every day). Thanks to this, I've lost 15 lbs from my starting weight of 268.\n\nNow, I'd like to start strength training so that I'm not only losing fat but maintaining/building muscle so that when I finally do lose all this weight I won't just be a nasty, wrinkly mass of skin. I plan on strength training 3 times a week. \n\nWhile at the gym earlier today (last night?), I wrote a list of weight machines I should use and I just wanted to get peoples' opinions on my routine and if there are any other machines I should use or any muscle groups I neglected in selecting the machines. \n\nBEFORE anyone says I shouldn't use weight machines, I'd just like to say I'd prefer them because I'm uncomfortable using free weights and that's just that. When I'm more confident in my ability to keep form while lifting, I'll go to free weights, until then, I'd like to know that I'm not going to drop anything on myself or peel my muscles from my bones (I'm quite attached to them, you know!) because I didn't do something right.\n\nAnyways, here's my list of machines:\nLeg press\nHip abduction/adduction\nLower back (that's all the machine said)\nCompound row\nVertical chest press\nPullover\nOverhead\n\nSummary: A woman is starting a strength training routine and wants opinions on her list of machines.\n\nFeedback: The summary is good, but should convey more details about the individuals situation. Concretely the individual is losing a lot of weight and now also wants to build muscles. The summary should also point out that the individual does not want to use free weights.\n\nTL;DR",

We've always joked about it and never really thought of it too seriously, but now that day is close. \n\nI'm not a particularly fast runner or an expert by any means. I've ran a marathon, I'm training to run a faster marathon and I plan[ned] to do my first ultra this spring.\n\nHowever, I don't know if any of this is doable with one kidney. I don't even know if doing a full marathon is possible. I spoke to my primary about it (she's not a specialist on the matter) and I'll meet with a nephrologist in a couple of months for an expert opinion. \n\nI'm feeling kind of lost. Running has become a part of my life and has made me a better human being. It isn't something I want to give up and I selfishly wish this donor thing could be put off for another 5 years so I can attempt my pipe dream goal of a 100mi ultra. \n\nI'm just wondering if there are any one kidney runners here to give me hope and inspiration for years to come.\n\nSummary: The author is training to run a marathon and an ultra, but is worried about how running these races will be possible with only one kidney. They are looking for advice and hope from other one kidney runners.\n\nFeedback: The summary is good and accurate. It should however also point out that the author is going to donate a kidney to their brother. It could also mention that the author talked to their primary doctor about running with one kidney.\n\nTL;DR",

We were both abused by my uncle/his father, who is currently in prison far away from us, and his mother signed over her rights to me. I've been Cousin's guardian for two years now, and we're doing well.\n\nRecently, our grandmother (uncle's mother) has tried to get into contact with us again. I cut off a huge swathe of my family during the trial \u2013 essentially everyone who was not explicitly on our side \u2013 and my grandmother was part of that. Grandmother wants to make amends for her \"ambivalence,\" and that she is not talking to my uncle.\n\nCousin loves Grandmother and was upset when I cut contact with her, even when I explained the situation, and I want to do right by him. But I do not trust her at all. If my uncle even finds out a smidge of information about Cousin, I will not be responsible for my actions. We do not live in a state with grandparent visitation rights, so I am not worried about legal repercussions, but I don't know how to approach anyone on that side of the family.\n\nSummary: My estranged grandmother wants to reconnect with me and my cousin, but I don't trust her and I don't know how to approach anyone on that side of the family.\n\nFeedback: The summary does not convey the most important parts of the text. The summary should mention that the author and his cousin were abused by the cousins father, who now sits in prison far away. This is the reason why the author cut off part of the family, including the grandmother, during the trial. The author thus doesn't trust the grandmother and doesn't know how to approach anyone on that side of the family.\n\nTL;DR",

Further it should mention that the girls father is slightly over protective and that her sister goes everywhere with here, which implies they have no alone time.

I, in turn, enjoy trolling him back. Recently, he received a dare to post something serious to his facebook as part of a prank. The way the prank works is that if somebody messages you about the serious thing you posted, you are given something by them to post on your wall. The joke spreads around like that, and is sort of stupid in my opinion. A few days later, I see he has posted to his wall \"My Grandmother went to heaven today.\" With the odd wording, and me hearing nothing of his grandma's ill health, I assumed it was another one of his prank posts to lure more people in to his silly joke. I thought it would be rather funny to mess with some of the believers in the comments of the post.\n\nI type \"Good riddance\" into the comments and, within seconds, I receive a reply from one of his friends I did not know saying \"That's horrible. Why would you say something like that?\" With a lack of better judgement, I decide not to hold back. I go on a rant spreading lies about his grandmother: \"She was a horrible person and a menace to society\", \"She even ran over my cat and never apologized\", \"I went to AssHat's house and saw alot of German WWII related items.\", \"That monster was literally a nazi!\", \"She's scum of the earth and we're better off without her.\"\n\nI felt pretty accomplished with my trolling, not even considering the possibilty his grandmother could have actually died. Later that night, I returned to facebook only to see my comments had been deleted, and AssHat's comment about the awful things I had said. Turns out his Grandmother had actually died that day, and I was the worst best friend in the world. I of course apologized profusely, and attempted to explain myself, but he was still ticked at me for a couple of days.\n\nSummary: Tried to troll my best friend, but accidentally killed his grandmother instead.\n\nFeedback: This summary is completely wrong and misses the point of the text, the authod did not try to kill anybody. The summary should make clear that the author tried to troll his friend, because they like to do this to each other. Concretely the friend made a facebook post saying his grandmother went to heaven, upon which the author wished her good riddance and accused her of being a nazi, because he thought the post was a joke. The author then apoligized to his friend, but the friend was still angry for a couple of days.\n\nTL;DR",

We broke up for about a year a couple of years back (1 kid at this stage) obviously both went off on the single scene.\n\nWe got back together and had another kid together. Recently I found out she was with a guy that she worked with years ago. They had been \"friends\" and texting each other on and off over the years. But when  we weren't together she ended up sleeping with this guy. He had a girlfriend at the time, think he still does.\n\nI recently confronted my partner about this and she told me that she didn't see any harm in texting him when we were together originally because \"nothing happened\". I'm finding it hard to believe that a guy would keep interest after 8 yrs (when they originally met) if he wasn't getting anywhere (unless they were just friends)\n\nUsually if this was one of my friends in this situation, I'd say fuck her. But the problem is we have 2 children and I can't bear the thought of not seeing them everyday. Or them growing up in a broken home.\n\nI don't know whether to believe what she is telling me or what to do. I can't think properly about the whole situation, I'm lost! \n\nTo make it worse, I found out where the guy lives and the temptention to fuck him up is going through my head. Have thought about finding his girlfriend and telling her. (They have been in a longterm relationship aswell as far as I know)\n\nSorry if this read seems a bit all over the place but I've never had to do anything like this before. Any advice would be great\n\nSummary: Girlfriend cheated on me a few years back, we got back together and had another kid. Recently found out she's been texting an old guy friend. Unsure whether to believe her or not and whether to stay with her or not.\n\nFeedback: The first sentence of the summary is good and should be kept, but the rest of the summary should be removed. The summary should make clear that while they were seaparated, the girlfriend slept with a guy that she had worked with and been friends with for years. The author is troubled by the fact that she had been texting this guy already when they were still together and his girlfriend said that nothing happenend at that time. The summary should convey that the author is unsure whether to believe her or not and what  to do, also because he does not want his kids to grow up in a broken home.\n\nTL;DR",

I like it okay, but I have been feeling really sad about missing out on being with my family and friends (and dogs!). This job has the potential to be a long running career for him and although the company does have multiple locations in multiple states I'm not sure they will ever be in the state my family is in. Which is a problem for me. \n\nI'm very much in love with him, and can see us getting married someday however I feel as though I'm at a crossroads, where if I commit to him its commiting to a life without my loved ones. And I have a really close relationship with my whole family. I knew I was moving to be with him but I didn't want it to be a long term commitment. I brought it up with him and he agreed that he isn't including me in his future plans but didn't seem to want to alter them. \n\nBefore we moved, it was loosely agreed that we would stay down here for a few years, he would chip away at his student loans while I either went back to school or found a job and saved up. Which sounded fine, but as of late he's been talking a lot about staying for the next 5 or even 10 years. And I'm not sure that's going to change....\n\nSummary: The text discusses a dilemma that a 24-year-old woman is facing.\n\nFeedback: This summary is too broad and lacks important details. It should convey that the author moved to a different state with her boyfriend, for what she thought would be a temporary period. She loves her boyfriend, but misses her family. It should also mention that the boyfriend suddenly considers staying there for a long time and the author is asking for advice on if she should break up and move back home or stay with her boyfriend.\n\nTL;DR",

It's not that I don't like to talk, I just don't usually talk unless I have something to say. That aside, women never talk to me first nor can they keep a conversation going. Even in group discussions in class, usually only the guys will discuss the topic with me. \n\nHere's the bizarre thing, I have a TON of gay friends that hit on me all the time. Why are the men so forward and confident, but women are all shy or uncomfortable / anxious around me? Tbh, I have the same amount of close gay friends as I have close straight guy friends. And obviously that ratio is pretty lopsided. And literally only women that I'm not very attracted to will try to be friends with me and they're always way cooler than most above average looking women(from my perspective). It's like there's some kind of tension there when I'm around attractive women. I don't know if it's what I say, or if I put off bad vibes, but it's usually only around attractive women. It's like even if I'm actually trying to hold a conversation, they don't contribute.\n\nMy luck has been bad enough to where I had sexual relations one time with my only best female friend and she has avoided hanging out with me ever since. I'm not sure what the problem was because we were pretty close. She didn't even give anything a chance, but I suspect this had to do with her relatively recent breakup.\n\nEvery women I've been with or been \"talking\" has said I'm too attractive for them. Idk if that's even related, but it's like they think they aren't good enough for me when I try to become more than friends. Sometimes I think how much easier it'd be if I was gay lol. Gay guys always find me one way or another, it happens all the time ha.\n\nAlso, my field of study has an inherent lack of women. That probably has a lot to do with the lack of women in my life in general. \n\nSo, what could the problem be??\n\nSummary: The author of the text discusses their difficulties with women. They explain that they are not socially awkward, but that women never talk to them first and that they have difficulty keeping a conversation going.\n\nFeedback: The summary should point out that the author specifically has difficulty interacting with attractive women. The summary should also point out that the author has a lot of gay friends who hit on him all the time. It's also easier to interact with women he considers to be less attractive. Lastly the summary should convey that the author is looking for explanations for that situation.\n\nTL;DR",

I was at a small party and I met him there. I was the youngest, I knew, everyone called me a 'jailbait' so I knew everyone was at least 1 or 2 years older than me.\n\nI had come there because a good girl friend of mine(f/20) asked me to come, and said it would be fun. I didn't want to go at first, but she begged me to, so I thought I'd just go to make her happy.\n\nThe guy I met and I talked for hours straight. When the party was over and I was back home again, we continued whatsapping, facebooking and skyping for hours nonstop. We have so much in common - we say the same things at the same time, we feel the same way about basically everything!\n\nNow, I have two problems here. First one is, that the girl that wanted me to come to the party, is a lesbian, I never thought anything of it - but apparently she's fallen in love with me. She is one of my closest friends. How do I politely tell her that I'm not going to date her? She's pushing me into it, I've been with a girl once for 4 months or so, but she knows that I'm not into girls anymore, but I guess she thinks she can force me into becoming a lesbian. At least, that's what it feels like.\n\nSecond, I really like the guy. I found out he was 23 later because he was ashamed of his age at first. We didn't really mention it at first because we just didn't think about it - we all knew I'm a 'jailbait' and I knew he had to be at least 18 or older, apparently our age difference is 6 years. I'm stressing over it. \n\nFor Valentines day he's going to take me out. I'm really excited for it and if we have the same click again, I think we will become a couple. Just... How do I tell my mom?\n\nSummary: How do I tell my family that I'm in love with someone that is 6 years older than me, and is not a girl?\n\nFeedback: The summary is slightly inaccurate, concretely the author is worried about telling her mother that she likes a guy who is 6 years older than her. The fact that it's a boy does not worry the author.

Anyway, l have never gone out with anyone. At least not in the romantic sense. I've never been asked either. I even went to my senior prom by myself. I was probably the only one there who didn't go with someone. I don't know.\n\n  Well, a little about myself. For starters, I'm gay. Most of my friends know lol. I'm really into (old) music. Goth, Punk, Deathrock, 80's indie/ jangle pop. I also like some non- alternative music, mostly old school. Some days, l look like l attended a Victorian funeral. Other days, l look like a cross dressing burlesque performer out of Tim Burton's mind. l also have a kick ass mohawk lol. Last l checked, it was almost 9 inches tall. But enough about me.\n\n  Back to the problem. I feel no likes me. Well, no one has shown any interest. Maybe l'm being impatient? I don't know. I guess l feel unattractive. Unwanted, perhaps? I also don't know if l want to meet someone through the internet (although l wouldn't be opposed to it). I'm not really sure how l should go about things.\n\n  I guess l haven't approached the right people? I mean, l can strike up a conversation with anyone. I have reasonably good social skills. Maybe no one will approach me? Not sure. I'm not trying to complain or anything. I just wanna put it out there. I'm sure there's something l'm not doing right.\n\n  I need input, at the very least. Perhaps a step in another direction that l haven't considered. There's not much else l can think of. I don't know if l should wait or what. I could end up waiting forever.

Basically my boyfriend told me he was going to be somewhere else, and I think he lied and went to go see this girl he used to have a lot of feelings for who just broke it off with her now ex. I asked him one night after we both drank a lot if he went to go see her and he said no.

The summary should also mention that the author believes her boyfriend visited an old flame very early on in their relationship, i.e. after 4 months.

(Guess where I'm from) I got my drivers permit about 2 months ago, bought a car two weeks later with my hard earned money from the summer. The car was shitty to others but a full blown race car to me. Looked like crap but ran like a champ. Anyways, I have never driven in the rain so I knew I'll run into trouble on my way back home from work. Hydro planing sounded familiar to me but never knew it's real consequences. Coming up to my turn where for a good mile (in Dominic torretto voice) I'm free. On the turn there was a huge size puddle of water. I tried to avoid it completly but knew and figured that the front right tire will hit the water. Remember that word \"hydroplane\", yeah I fucked up. The left front tire went over then sunk, causing me the turn into the side of the road. Closer to the edge, the water is deeper. My engine choked, I'm really fucked. Knew trying to keep turning the key will only make things worst. I got out, in ankle deep water, had the bitch in neutral and pushed to the corner of the turn. On the bright side of this whole predicament, a trucker got out of his rig and helped me push the water logged car to the edge. Once out of the water, I tried to give life to my racecar. Once she turned back on I booked it home. Ran the same as before except for a knocking noise. The noise just hurts thinking about it. From the advice from other gearheads, it can't be easy to fix or safe to use without causing more damage. Already made a craigslist ad to at least get some money for another one.

I have been best friends with A (I'll call her that here) for almost 10 years.

Basically all we have is each other and our boyfriends. But that's it.)\n\nMy thoughts on this are that since she is always talking shit about everyone, other people over the years must think that I am like that too.

The house was rebuilt brand new within the past few years, and we knew we just had to have it when we saw it. The process has been relatively painless up to this point, including the resolution of several things from the home inspection process.\n\nFast forward to yesterday: law office sends over a correspondence letting us know that one of the sellers has died, but the remaining spouse still intends to move forward with the sale. Instant remorse and sorrow set in; despite hardly knowing the person. Then my wife brings up a valid point: what if the person died in the house? Will we still be comfortable to move forward ourselves, given that knowledge? I dismissed this, figuring hey the sellers are young, it probably was an accident of some sort (not trying to sound insensitive here, just trying to get my point across).\n\nI spoke to our lawyer last night, and basically was told that we are in a binding contract, and (barring a homicide or wrongful death in the house of sorts) would need to move forward so long as the seller wishes to move forward. Outside of this, we would need to involve a litigator, and that will create a huge headache I an sure.\n\nNow, we just found out that the seller did indeed die in the house (suddenly).\n\nI don't know how to feel or what to think. Maybe we're overreacting? My wife is more disturbed over the situation then I am, but I still feel unrest. Any and all advice or constructive criticism is welcome. Are we right to feel this way? Or should we just try to brush it under the rug, so to speak?\n\nSummary: House we're purchasing has had a death in it, sellers still intend to move forward. Wife and I are unsettled. What should we do?\n\nFeedback: This summary is accurate, it should however point out that the author's lawyer has confirmed that they are still in a binding contract. The summary should also convey that the author is asking if he and his wife are overreacting or if they are right to feel this way.\n\nTL;DR",

(hasn't been afraid of it previously)\n\nText: I have a chihuahua (pug mix) dog, (1 yr/5 months old). We usually take him for walks around the gated apartment complex, where the gardens are at, the neighbors have a basketball hoop (the ones filled with water to keep it standing). One day they left a carpet out in the sun to dry & he quite like it (he was rubbing/nudging on it & I guess when the thing shook/or when I lifted him to hop on the carpet it scared him).  Ever since he hasn't been ANYWHERE near it, he doesn't want to even go outside anymore near that area (he'll just go potty & come right back inside).  I have tried carrying him over there and just holding him walking towards it, but right when I put him down he runs for his life back home. Tail is in between his legs, never seen him like that before.\n\nHe has never been afraid of going over there before at all, EVER, always had to go over there to potty on his usual spots, and has never had a problem until that incident...\n\nI have never seen him afraid of anything before like this.  Also, not sure if this is because recently a neighbor brought their friends dog over to play (near that area/female retriever/poodle mix but he's never seen her).\n\nI have tried to put snacks (in a trail) near there and have him slowly go out so he wouldn't be afraid, but once he eats all the snacks in the trail, he runs right back home.\n\nI have also attempted to put the snacks on the basketball hoop base & he has just eaten the food (or merely ignored it in panic/looking up all the time to see if anything is going to fall on him or something)...\n\nWhenever he leaves his safety area (home) he looks up & around but mostly up... How can I help him see that the basketball hoop is not dangerous? (ie. it's secure & won't fall over anytime soon even in gusty wind conditions)\n\nSummary: My dog is afraid of the basketball hoop that's always been there, but he hasn't been afraid of it previously.\n\nFeedback: This summary is accuracy but could mention more details. The author believes that his chihuahua is scared because of a carpet that was left to dry close on the hoop, that the dog first liked but then got scared of because it shook. The author also considers that a neighbor's friend's dog could be the reason why his chihuahua is scared.

They explain that their friend is using cocaine more frequently and that they are worried about the negative effects it may have on him.\n\nFeedback: The summary is accurate but repetitive. The first sentence is good, but the second sentence should be removed. The summary should point out that the author is falling in love with her friend. The summary should provide more details on the dilemma, concretely  the author fears that contronting their friend would lead to them stop talking which would make things wors for her friend even more.

As I resume the series I take a few huge sips from the bottle while watching, I hold in my laugh to finish what I have in my mouth and stupid me decides to take another huge sip. My mouth full of coke as I can't retain my laughter, spouting it all over my laptop, out of my nose and mouth. The result: My laptop is sticky as hell as i'm cleaning it as much as possible while typing this from my mobile.\n\nSummary: Took a sip of coke while watching anime, sprayed it all over my laptop.\n\nFeedback: The summary lacks important details of the text.

I'm not sure. \n\nI am currently training for my first half- and full-marathons, in Chicago this September and October. I have been running consistently for the last few months. Maybe not as much as I should, but running 8 miles at 80 minutes was no problem and something I did a few times per week. I had a 14 miler that had some walking, and many shorter ones. \n\nTwo weeks ago I left to do some traveling. I packed my gear and intended to do some serious running while away. But I was quickly frustrated because I couldn't seem to run more than 2 miles without losing all steam. At first I thought I just had a bad day. But it's been two weeks now, and not once have I managed three straight miles. \n\nThese are all my guesses: \n\n1. Switched time of day that I run: I was running late mornings, early afternoons. During my trip, I had to shift to the early mornings. I figure this was needed anyway, since the half and full marathons are morning runs. \n\n2. Change of bed? \n3. Stress due to travel? This was all in the northern midwest, though, so I wasn't grappling with significant climate or elevation changes. \n4. Change of diet? I had been eating fairly lean before, but then was wiped out by a hard run for days at a time. A friend told me I should be eating a lot more. I increased my diet, and my running plummeted. \n5. Reduction in alcohol consumption. Yeah, this one is weird. I was drinking too much and cut way back, down to nothing for a week (which is a long time for me). Energy plummeted a few days later. \n\nAny thoughts? Anyone have a similar experience? Should I be worried?\n\nSummary: Trying to run a half or full marathon, but struggling to run more than 2 miles in a row. Frustrated and unsure what to do.\n\nFeedback: The summary does not convey the important parts of the text. It should make clear that the author has been training successfully for a while and ran 8 miles without any problems. However, since they left for travels, they are not able to run more than 2 miles in a row and are looking for thoughts on why this may be. The summary should also mention a few possibilities that the author lists, namely, switching time of running, stress due to travel, change of diet and reduction in acohol consumption.\n\nTL;DR",

As I know, he didn't *actually* cheat on me, however in my heart it feels the same--if not worse because he actually PURSUED a relationship, not just sex. He said he regretted it pretty early on but they continued to be together for two months, and not once did he try to contact me to work things out. \n\nIt was short lived, apparently, and he's back saying he fucked up and he realized his mistakes and \"realized\" that what we have is a once in a lifetime sort of thing. I'm hesitant. I feel so hurt and betrayed, and I feel very disillusioned about our relationship in general. I love him and I am still so very much in love with him, but I just don't really feel as though he won't ever experience grass is greener syndrome again. But then again, we are still young and immature with how we handle things so maybe he did really learn?\n\nSo what I'm really asking is to hear about others' experiences with a situation such as this. Is it worth giving him a second chance?\n\nSummary: Partner of 5.5 years left me for someone else, now wants to come back. Is it worth giving him a second chance?\n\nFeedback: This summary is good overall, it should however mention that the boyfriend realized that leaving her was a mistake since they had a once in a lifetime thing. Also the boyfriend was only in a relationship with the other person for 2 month. The summary should also mention that the author still loves her boyfriend, but is unsure if something like this could happen again. She is wondering if it is worth giving him a second chance and if others have had similar experiences.\n\nTL;DR",

What started off smoldering has really faded out the past few months. She was originally going to go to California for Grad School and decided to stay where we live to be with me essentially. I didn't ask her to do this, I advocated for her to leave. Ultimately I supported her decision because that's what you're supposed to do. Fast forward a couple of months later we are living together and everything is great, but we've only been together a few months. Over the course of the past few months I've become increasingly annoyed by her for no apparent reason. She's extremely needy and clingy and wants words of affirmation/kisses/cuddles constantly, but I don't feel the want to kiss her very often. I have begun to see her as more of a great friend whom I love, but I'm  not sure if I am in love with her. Are there any tips for becoming less annoyed from anyone in a similar situation? She honestly does nothing wrong and I'm extremely appreciative of everything that she does for me. I'm just not entirely happy. Any advice?\n\nSummary: I'm not sure if I'm in love with my girlfriend anymore, but I'm living with her and don't know what to do.\n\nFeedback: The summary lacks detail and should mention that the author gets annoyed by many things that his girlfriend does, for no apparent reason.

I stand there for about 5 seconds feeling extremely awkward about it until i finally say goodbye.\n\nSummary: Accidentally asked an American if he could speak English, and he said no.\n\nFeedback: This summary is wrong, the author said hi in danish to a person in the street wearing an american footabl t-shirt.

My shifts are timetabled around availability and lectures so sometimes I won't see some of the people on my team for weeks at a time. Worked my first shift with one of my coworkers a couple months ago and my first reaction was that he is totally my type but I should just get over it because I should be professional.

He's quite a quiet guy and I see him around every now and again on campus outside of work, but not much.\n\nThen I fucked up and caught feelings. \n\nHere's the kicker: because of timetabling availabilities, I haven't seen him since mid-December and I don't know whether it's weird for me to have feelings for him even though we haven't talked or seen each other for almost a month and a half. He graduates this year so part of me wants to pursue it, but the other part of me really really doesn't want to make things awkward at work. I also know that he's busy with extra-curricular activities and his degree as well, so I don't want to waste his time. I've been to some nights out where I thought that he would go as well with his friends as so I could 'coincidentally bump into him' but he doesn't show for most of them so I haven't hung out with him outside work.\n\nSummary: I have a crush on a coworker and I'm not sure whether to pursue it or not because I'm worried about making things awkward at work.\n\nFeedback: The summary is accurate.

He pulls the pity card any time I try to rationalize his situation with him and look for a way out.  I have to admit, I have been enabling him. I have allowed him to remain on my cell phone provider's family plan (for free) as well as utilize one of my checking accounts to pay some of his bills with the small amount of money he has to his name.\n\nTonight I found out that he has overdrawn on the checking account, so I am going to close that tomorrow. I have also since switched cell phone carriers to be on my wife's family plan (to save money), so the cell service is going to be cancelled tomorrow as well, seeing as it is only burning a hole in my fiscal pocket.\n\nI can talk with him until I'm blue in the face. I can take responsible action concerning my end of things. But there seems to be nothing to motivate him. He has had ample time to go out and get a job. He was a big rig driver (all of those jobs he squandered), now he could at least go out and get a menial job just for the income, but he doesn't. He's exhausted his retirement, fails to drawn on his pension (because he believes that he can't 'yet', so he doesn't try...either way I think it is small and he only gets half because of a divorce settlement), and he's in the process of losing his house and everything he owns.\n\nAfter I close the accounts tomorrow, what do I do?!\n\nSummary: Father is unwilling to do anything for himself, enabling has done no good, what do I do now?\n\nFeedback: The summary should point out that the son of the father has been enabling him.

It may not be a lot for some of you more experienced college kids/ working men/women, but for me i was swamped.\n\nHere is a list of the work i had to do:\n\n1. A 10 page term paper that was required to include 10 sources (2 of which from actual books and not the internet) in APA style format. \n\n2. A 2 week nutrition diary that i had to include times of day and the calories that each item had, which of course i completely bullshitted.\n\n3.

(Because I'm studying exercise science) A Detailed workout regiment of at least 3 times per week that i have done and what affect they have plus the duration/rep count/intensity/sets.\n\n5. Practice and conditioning for baseball - trust me this does eat up a lot of god damn time, plus the time it takes to get ready, get to the field, and to shower afterwards.\n\n6. Actually going to class - I'm going to throw this in there because it did eat up a good portion of the time i could have been working on the work mentioned above.\n\nAgain, this may not sound like a lot, but each of these activities were very time consuming and it took many energy drinks, a sleepless night,  and a damn good amount of motivation to complete aka not getting on Reddit.

Btw this was over the span of 2 days because it's a mix of my Monday-Wednesday-Friday classes and my Tuesday-Thursday classes.\n\nSummary: I had to do a month's worth of work in 2 days because I procrastinated.\n\nFeedback: The summary is inaccurate, it should replace \"a month's\" with \"a weeks\". Further the summary is too vague and should provide more details on the text. It should mention taht the author is asking other people \"what is the most amount of work you have done in a short period of time\".

I'm a doormat\n\nText: My boyfriend (26) is the kind of guy who doesn't put up with crap. He calls out people when they're wrong, yells at bad drivers, and uses the word \"dumbass\" very liberally. I should clarify that it's never excessive, violent, or directed at me. I kind of admire his assertiveness sometimes. A lot of people would probably see this as a reasonable level of emotion, but I have some problems dealing with it.\n\nAs I mentioned, I (24) am a doormat. I very, very rarely get angry at anything. My usual response to conflict is to curl up into a ball and cry. I was also physically abused by my father as a kid, because of his anger management issues. When other people are angry, I feel awkward and terrified. I'm working with a therapist to try to get over some of my emotional problems. So far I can successfully deal with anger from/get angry at my sister and my best friend without it being a big deal. With other people, any form of conflict just sits in my mind and scares me.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have been dating for 8 months. He knows all about my issues, accepts them, and is always very kind and collected when we're working out minor problems together. But he still gets very angry at other people, and himself. We have similar interests, and I feel more comfortable talking to him than to anyone else. Our relative anger levels just seem incompatible.\n\n I've talked to him about how people getting angry scares me, and he's very understanding of that. I know it's not right to want someone in a relationship to change. I know that's part of who he is and I admire it a bit, but I don't really want to have to become agressive to accept it either. Most of all, I'm terrified of either one of us becoming angry with each other. I know it probably has to happen eventually, and I don't want to get scared and end the relationship.\n\nSummary: Girl has trouble dealing with boyfriend's anger, fears becoming angry herself and ending relationship.\n\nFeedback: This summary is wrong, the girl does not fear becoming angry herself, she actually fears conflict and was physically abused by her father as a kid. The summary should point out that her boyfriend knows about the authors issues, accepts them and is kind and collected with working out problems. The author fears that at some point they will get angry at each other, which will scare her and make her potentially end the relationship.\n\nTL;DR",

We've both been itchy af and have been to the doctor who confirmed that it was scabies for the both of us. Our room mate (20m) has not had symptoms of scabies bites appear yet but I have asked him to get treated as well and to treat his clothes and linen so that our apartment does not get reinfested after treatment.\n\nMy room mate refuses to buy the lotion needed to kill the mites on his skin (if there are any on him) and refuses to rewash and dry his linen and clothes. I'm scared that if he does not get treated the infestation of our apartment will not go away. I'm almost there to asking him to move out if he refuses treatment . He is not on the lease.\n\nSummary: My fiance and I contracted scabies, roommate refuses to get treated and may move out if he doesn't.\n\nFeedback: The summary should make clear that the author might ask the roomate to move out if he does not get treated.

Now it's three weeks later (midst of exams) and I'm starting to get the feeling that she's not thinking of this as a \"relationship\" in the conventional bf/gf sense. I'm new to the whole dating game and wondering a few things. \n\nDo I need to ask if we're together as bf/gf or is that implied by asking her out multiple times? Should I straight up ask if she likes me the way I like her? I know what the friend zone is and I'm not feeling there, yet, but we're having a movie night tomorrow just her and I. I plan on seeing what's what then by trying to get physical, not hardcore, just simple stuff like leg touches, cuddling etc. Oh and finally, to add to my lengthy situation, On our third \"date\" (studying for an exam) I drove her home and attempted to kiss her but got the infamous cheek. I didn't make a big deal about it I just moved past said \"got your things?\" and politely said goodbye preceding to wait for her to get inside her house. I've been told I shouldn't fret about ONE kiss rejection cause there could be multiple reasons for it but at the same time that made me think more about the friend zone possibility. \n\nAny advice or similar situations and how you solved the problem would be smashing! Thanks in advance.\n\nSummary: A guy is trying to figure out if he's in a relationship with a girl and if she likes him back.

The summary should point out that the author is asking if he should just ask the girl what their relationshp is. The author also mentions that when he had one kiss rejection and is wondering if he might have been friend zoned.\n\nTL;DR",

I have not yet found a good substitute for chocolate. I have decent self control and I've tried removing it from my diet, but, when I do this, I continue to crave it (even after not taking it for multiple weeks). I don't want to continue craving it, so do you have any suggestions for addressing this problem? I am more interested in substitutes than in eating less chocolate, because I still get the cravings if I simply eat less of it, so is there some healthy substitute that is compatible with getting thinner that you could recommend?\n\nSummary: Need a good chocolate substitute that doesn't involve eating less chocolate.\n\nFeedback: The summary is badly phrased. It should make clear that the author is trying to lose weight and has already removed some things from his diet.

His most recent text would be something like \"I see\" or \"gotchya\" or \"nice\" or something and wonder why I wouldn't respond sometimes.

First off, I've already made an appointment with a lawyer but I figured as much information as possible couldnt hurt.\n\nIn february, I rear-ended a car after skidding on water.  The car accident was pretty minimal honestly (my airbags didn't deploy/car function fine/only cosmetic damage).  A cop was called and took accounts and photos.  The guy seemed irritated but not hurt in the least.  I gave him/the police my insurance and contact information.  As far as I knew he took care of it and I hadn't heard from him.\n\nApparently, the cop miswrote my cell number (making a 1 look like a 7) and the guy had been trying to contact me.  I found out my insurance policy that had been in effect was cancelled due to lack of payment (I was on my parents insurance and I was unaware they hadn't paid/they did not inform me).  I got my own insurance asap but I found out I was basically boned because I technically didn't have insurance during the time the accident occurred.\n\nThis morning I received a manila envelope on my car windshield addressed to me.  In it, the guy wrote me a letter describing his attempts to contact me.  Additionally, he included a large amount of my information he could find online (facebook photos, employee page, white pages info, etc.).  He also included the incident report and two quotes for repairs to his damages.  He's seeking me to pay him in a cash order for the full repair of his car or he will seek more, including damages for \"whiplash and a concussion\" although as far as I can tell he has no proof of either.  Basically, what is my best option here.\n\nAlso, while I know he had active insurance, am I responsible for the full amount or for whatever the deductible would be?\n\nSummary: guy seeking damages from me for rear-ending his car, claiming I caused his injuries even though they don't seem legit.\n\nFeedback: The summary should mention that the original poster didn't know that he had no insurance at the time of the accident and that this could cause problems to him. It is also important that the writer is asking for advice on what to do in this situation. \n\nTL;DR",

Should I be concerned?\n\nText: I'm pretty sure this is a stupid thing to be concerned about in the grand scheme of things, but I could use some input.\n\nI was looking for one of his friends who got married recently (couldn't remember her amended last name, but I knew they were facebook friends) so I went to his profile to check his friends and locate her. But I could only see our mutual friends. And I thought it was weird. And then I noticed that his profile was pretty much the only one where I could not see a complete friends list, so I'm thinking he's got privacy filters set. \n\nNow, I KNOW he updates his filters regularly (a long while back we were having some relationship issues, and I was blocked from seeing most of his profile for a brief period of time), and he has coworkers on his friends list and screens his posts from some of them. \n\nThe thing is, I don't think I'm an overly clingy girlfriend (and he has said numerous times that I'm not). I don't try to control every aspect of his life. So I'm not sure why I no longer have full access. \n\nI'm concerned because he's had a habit in the past of poor communication (which he has attempted to work on). But he does tend to close off, and if he DID have something he wanted to keep from me, this seems like one of the ways he might attempt to do so.\n\nIs it acceptable to ask if it was just an oversight or if it was intentional? Is there a good WAY to ask? Is it possible/likely that it is just a mistake? Or is it possible he has something to hide? I'm not going to fly off the handle; it's just that his track record has been such that this could be nothing, or it could be SUPER HUGE, and I won't know until it's too late.\n\nSummary: I can't see my boyfriend's entire friends list on Facebook, and I'm wondering if I should be concerned.\n\nFeedback: This summary is good overall. However, it is important mentioning that the original poster's boyfriend has habits of bad communication and that the filters on FB profile could be hiding something important for their relationship. \n\nTL;DR",

My previous high weight was 306lbs, and this time last year I had gotten down to 184lbs. I had a surgery last spring, fell into a depression, ate literally nothing but junk food for a year, and gained half of my lost weight back. \n\n30 days ago, I got fed up with myself and decided to get my shit together. I dusted off my MFP account and my kitchen scale, started logging everything I ate, and haven't touched fast food or soda since. \n\nNow, one thing I haven't mentioned yet is that I am a dialysis patient. I got a rare autoimmune disease when I was 19 and almost died. I had to drop out of university and move back across the country to live with my parents. Lots of crazy shit has happened since then, and I will be on dialysis for the rest of my life. Part of managing this is going to doctor appointments in the local peritoneal dialysis clinic every three months. They do bloodwork, you meet with a dietician, you meet with a pharmacist, they check blood pressures and things, and you meet with a doctor. Takes about three hours. \n\nMy bloodwork has traditionally been shitty. My phosphorus, calcium, potassium levels have been all over the place. I was on 10 pills a day to manage my calcium alone. \n\nNow, on to the actual point of this post. \n\nAt my clinic appointment yesterday, I was informed that ALL of my bloodwork fell in the normal range. \n\nALL of it. \n\nI've been taken off more than 50% of my medications because I don't need them anymore. \n\nThe dietician/nutritionist (is there a difference? i don't know) was astonished. She said she was proud of me for making such a significant change through my diet alone. The doctor was impressed too, which really meant a lot to me because she's a very strict, no-nonsense type. She isn't the type to say something just to make someone feel better. \n\nAnyway,\n\nSummary: I lost a significant amount of weight (for me, at least) through diet alone, and my bloodwork has normalized as a result.\n\nFeedback: This summary is bad and does not convey the important points of the text. The summary should mention how the author suffers froma rare autoinmune disease and is a dialysis patient. It should further point out that thanks to the weight reduction she was able to cut 50% of her medication and that impressed doctors. \n\nTL;DR",

At the time I was madly in love with her and was not confident enough to think I would be able to be with anyone who was as attractive or compatible.  During that period of the two break ups she cheated on me and told me about it years later because of guilt.  \n\nFast forward to now, I have definitely evolved as a person.  I am more confident and it has captured the attention of a lot of attractive girls.  Every time I go out with my friends and get the attention of a girl, I think to myself, \"maybe I'm entitled to this.\"  Of course, I respect my girlfriend too much to act on those desires.  \n\nYesterday I tried breaking up with her by bringing up some excuse about a potential possibility of a long distance relationship.  The conversation we had made me think about how long we've been together, how much I really like her, how committed she's been since then and how special what we have is.  \n\nEvery time I think about her cheating on me I get upset, every time a girl asks if I want to walk her home after a night of drinking I have second thoughts.  I wish there was some way to say, \"hey you had your fun, I want mine and then we can get back together,\" but I know that is not realistic. \n\nI really do care about this girl and can see myself with her in the long run, but also wish I could have my time to do me.

They are worried about the potential implications of breaking up, but are unsure of what to do.\n\nFeedback: The summary is not correct. The summary should mention that the authors girlfriend broke up twice with him and cheated on him during that period. The summary also has to mention that the author is now thinking about breaking up because he wants to live the single life and have fun with other women. The author wants advice on what to do, since he loves his girlfriend also very much and wants to be together with her in the long run.\n\nTL;DR",

So, when trying to fill cups of tartar and sour cream, I have some issues flipping and separating the cups. I thought I had a great idea: since the cups, much less the outside of the cups, are not food, let's not wear a glove; thought that cutting the tips off would be more fun. I neglected to remove my hand from the glove, and snipped the tips off my left index and middle fingers before I transformed my left ring fingerprint forever. That knife, as with all of our knives, are PARTICULARLY dull, so I had breezed that one through the (shitty) carbide pull sharpener a few times when I got in.\n\nWhen going to get a napkin to staunch the flow and then ask for a bandage, I slipped on the freshly mopped area just outside the doors.\n\nNot 20 minutes later, when returning the bucket of sour cream to the walk-in cooler, I again biffed on the freshly mopped floor of the cooler.\n\nSummary: Snipped my fingers, bled all over the kitchen, and then fell on my ass.

I drove the mile from my house to the farm to get my paycheck only to find that it was shorted a day. I immediately brought it up to the owners wives who promised to remedy the situation. \n\nTurns out that the same night I was there, possibly the exact moment, someone was stalking the wagons in the woods, and fired a BB gun at a customer, wounding her. My phone was dead and my tv was stolen so I had no idea what had occurred when I went back to follow-up on my pay the following weekend The woman at the desk identified me, called the boss, who called the detectives, who came and interrogated me. \n\nNormally, I recognize that it is a terrible idea to talk to cops because self-incrimination and all, but I was caught completely off-guard and had no idea what was going on until I eventually caught on to what had happened and they filled me in. Regardless, I may feel undervalued by with the employer but I am not a psychotic criminal. \n\nI fear that I have told them too much (which is true past hello) and that if they don't catch the perp then they will come after me. I agreed to a polygraph, and talked to my lawyer, who told me not to do it because it often comes out inconclusive. I cut off contact with detectives whom hopefully recognize that I am honest and harmless. Nonetheless, my family has been freaking out at the thought of getting raided and/or searched based on circumstantial evidence.\n\nSummary: got fired from a job, found out that someone had been stalking the wagon and shot someone, and now I'm worried about being implicated and searched/raided.\n\nFeedback: This summary misses some important points.

We eventually moved in together, expecting nothing to happen. However, a kiss happened, and a lot of cuddling/relationship talk happened. We rocked back and forth from making the relationship \"a summer thing\" and carrying it on into the school year. We eventually agreed that it would carry on into the school year, but take it slow because he didn't want to be in a relationship just yet. We sneak out and cuddle and whatnot the second night, but it seems as though another girl liked him as well. She likes him, and I like him, but from what he says, he only likes me and does not like her. One night he tells me he is sleeping, but I find that he's in the room with that girl, alone. He sleeps over, and tells me nothing. He doesn't seem to tell me until i asked him, and I accept his apology, but am hurt because he lied/avoided the question. Now we've talked and somewhat agreed that we should take a break, but I'm really vulnerable. I tell him that he can hang out with her because she doesn't know we were once in a relationship, but it hurts me a lot to see them together.

She. wants her space she says, and maybe in a few months we'll work it out. She doesn't want to work it out because she feels like she needs to focus on herself and that I've had too many chances. I love this girl. Do I keep fighting or just wait it out? I don't know.\n\nSummary: My girlfriend is unhappy and is breaking up with me, but still lives with me and wants to cuddle. Do I keep fighting or just wait it out?\n\nFeedback: The summary is quite correct but should mention that the original poster gilrfriend is unhappy because the writer has been a shitty boyfriend lately. \n\nTL;DR",

Things have been great, have have the usual rocky road every once in a while but nothing terrible. Anyways to my question, within the past couple of months I have been noticing more and more that my gf, as it feels like to me, does not hear/pay attention to me. \n\nI have brought this issue up to her and she assures me she does indeed love me and listens to me, but there are still many times throughout each day that I find that I personally feel as though I am not receiving the acknowledgement I feel is good for the relationship for both sides. \n\nJust for clarification she is doing great in the relationship. No big problems, no worries.\n\nSummary: GF doesn't seem to be paying attention to me, is this my fault or hers?\n\nFeedback: The summary misses the main point of the original post. The summary should point out that the author has talked  with his girlfriend about the issue of her not paying attention to him. It should also say that his girlfriend assured him she loves him, but that the author still feels as though he is not acknowledged enough.\n\nTL;DR",

Since doing so I've spent most of my time when not working, on reddit. Ignoring my SO while doing so. So she was complaining saying \"Now you're never going to pay any attention to me\" and half jokingly I said \"well if you're on the front page of reddit I will\".\n\n   She took this to heart made an account and a rage comic to try and do so, surprisingly it worked I noticed it and it meant a lot that she cared enough to do so. But she got really upset by the comments, people telling her she was probably not a girl, a karma whore, she should feel bad for making such a bad comic ect. I tried to explain that it was just a bunch of but-hurt bitches who cared about fake internet points a little too much but she said she didn't want to go on reddit anymore. \n\n   So I just wanted to make this self post to say fuck you all you fucking karma caring losers for scaring away a new reddit user that could have made a lot of you laugh with future comics and stories.\nAlso Thank you all of you who upvoted and said nice things of encouragement that also got her to the front page.\n\n   \n  One of the reasons I liked reddit so much when I first came here was the nice helpful community, it seems the community had changed into a bunch of little karma mining little-dicks. I'll stay because I know what reddit can be, but she wont and she might of even posted a picture to gonewild if she wasn't treated so badly for a comic(that quite frankly I've seen so many comics of people just ranting about shit in a comic just to get karma and no one says anything, those are far worse then her funny little story)\n\nSummary: Reddit has become really mean and the community is full of but-hurt little-dicks who care about fake internet points.\n\nFeedback: The summary is quite correct but it does not mention that the original poster thoughts about Reddit are motivated by his girlfriend starting to use it and receiving bad comments in one of her posts. After this experience she is quitting from Reddit. \n\nTL;DR",

Full story inside.\n\nText: 18/M, in relationship for 1 year.\nMy girlfriend has a friend. Let's call him \"Tom.\" Tom (18/M) likes my girlfriend and dislikes me. Now, one day, I decide to buy my girlfriend, let's call her \"Meredith,\" her first vibrator. Meredith (18/F) is very sexually inexperienced with this stuff, is a virgin, hasn't came her entire life. But she IS into some things that are \"kinky.\" Mostly bondage where she claims the role of submissive. Tom was there when we bought the vibrator and decided to stay the night at her house. I was unaware of this but hey, Tom seems like a cool guy. Anyways, what transpired during that night is Tom groped Meredith and used the vibrator on her for around 6 minutes. This gave her her first orgasm.\n\nNow, I talked to Tom about this. He said she put up no resistance and seemed to enjoy it. She said she put up no resistance because it's her \"sexual nature\" to \"be submissive\" like that.\nShould this be a valid excuse?\n\nSummary: 18/M, girlfriend's friend groped and used vibrator on her for 6 minutes, girlfriend says it's because of her \"sexual nature\" to \"be submissive.\" Is this a valid excuse?\n\nFeedback: The summary is correct but should also mention that original poster's girlfriend is a virgin and that this was the first time she came. \n\nTL;DR",

A few weeks ago, one of my housemates used a baking pan of mine. He waited 2 or 3 days to wash it and it stained the pan. Yesterday, he's heating up a frozen pizza on it and cuts it was what seems to be a butcher knife. He left 2 massive gauges in it. It really pissed me off but I went to my other buddies first to tell them about it. I told them what was wrong and asked if I was overreacting. They said I kinda was (I don't really think I was). I decided not to tell him about it because, it's a pan, whatever. Fast forward to today, he comes into my room with a new pan and angrily says to me \"I went and bought you a new pan because apparently ones with scratches in 'em don't work anymore.\" Then he huffs and walks out. It's not even the pan that I'm mad about necessarily, it's that he treat my stuff like crap. That's what really pisses me off. Because I know if I treated his stuff like that, he'd be just as pissed as I am. I'm also pissed that my friends girlfriend decided to tell him about me being pissed off. But I'm not even going to say anything to her because apparently expressing my feelings is wrong...\n\nSummary: My housemate used a baking pan I left stained and then used a butcher knife on a frozen pizza and left 2 gashes in it.\n\nFeedback: The summary misses a very important point of the original post and should mention that the original poster is pissed about how his housemate treats his stuff. It is important too that after leaving 2 gashes in the bakin pan the housemate bought a new one. \n\nTL;DR",

What can I [26 M] do to fix this?\n\nText: There are a few things that she does very well, and I praise her for it. But she assumes/thinks she's excellent at everything she does, and that isn't true. \n\nFor example, the other day she wrote a song, and there was a line that it didn't make sense. I told her:\n\n \"Hey, I don't really get X line. It doesn't make much sense because it implies Y when I know you're actually trying to say Z\"\n\nSo instead of her taking the feedback, think about it for a second, or argue why she wrote that way. She freaked out, and said that I was wrong. How is it even possible that I understood that line like that, etc... \n\nAt another time, she cooked something and she put too much salt on the food. She asked \"How is it?\" and I told her \"I really liked X and Y, but I think Z is a bit salty for my taste\"\n\nShe freaked out again. She told me that's how the dish is and that I don't have an 'educated' palate.\n\nI could keep going and going, but I think you get the point. Every single time I give her feedback, and I tell her that she can do something better. She freaks out because she think she has a gift to be great at everything she does. She has quite literally said that.\n\nWhat is an effective way to give her honest feedback without her freaking out?\n\nSummary: The text contains a man's question on how to give his wife feedback without her freaking out. He lists several examples of when he has given her feedback in the past, and notes that she always freaks out.\n\nFeedback: The summary is accurate but should provide more details. Concreteley the wife believes she has a gift to be great at everything she does and is arrogant. She does thus not take criticism well and even accuses the author of being wrong.

I'm so looking forward to the new year :)\nThis post is more \"me centered\", just to let you know.\n\nMy situation is a little unusual because I am a transgender man (meaning I was born a girl).\n...So with that, I have no ability to impregnate my wife (or anyone for that matter). My brother was willing to be a donor for when we felt the time was right. \nAfter going through legal details and lots of medical testing, My wife is now 5 weeks pregnant!\n\nWe are ages 27 & 28, 4 years married (So close to 5!), financially stable, recently moved from our apartment into a house. \n\nWe are so thrilled to start a family. Late nights and long talks about parenting have brought out lots of details and plans. Of course we talked about my gender identity and what aspects of it could effect our child, Positive and Negative. We feel a bit stuck.\n(We both agree that being honest to our child is important)\n\nI'm just worried about their future. What if I don't explain things right. \nThe facts are that:\ndad is transgender, doesn't have boy parts (even though he is hairy, sounds like a boy and doesn't have a chest), dad can't have babies... so .... obviously.\n\nAlong with trying not to confuse my child, I'm concerned for our safety. \nI am legally male and apart from my close friends, doctors and family, Nobody knows about my transition. \nSo many bad things happen to transgender people, simply because they are trans. I've lived through a hate based attack, and since then I've been terrified of having people finding out. I now live in more accepting city, but I can never be to sure. \n\nAny input or advice you might have on the situation is greatly appreciated.\nThanks!\n\nSummary: Transgender man is going to be a father, worried about how to tell his child and the safety of his family.\n\nFeedback: This summary is very accurate. The summary could also mention that the father is worried about telling his child because of the implications it could have not being the natural father. Also he has experienced hate attacks from others, which is why he is worried about safety.\n\nTL;DR",

We were almost immediately great friends.  I have always been nice to her and supported her in the things she has done.  \n\nMy friend, let's call her Blake, and I used to text everyday from the beginning of freshmen year of high school until our first semester in college.

Then, on some random day, she stopped replying to me and has never contacted me again.  I have wished her happy holidays, birthday, etc and nothing.  Really I just want opinions on why this may be.  I guess I just miss having that really close friend that I could talk to about anything.\n\nSummary: Had a really close friend for 5 years, we texted everyday, then she stopped replying to me and never contacted me again.

The problem in the title has been presented to me recently and I don't know how to approach it. Last August I was desperately looking for an apartment before college started and settled on moving in with two friends, who were a couple. Here's a breakdown I'll try to keep as unbiased as possible.\n\n* We each paid $367.\n* The girl in the couple was preggers at the time.\n* I did not physically sign the lease because I had no means of transportation at the time. I sent them the money and they signed it. \n* The lease was for August through the end of April.\n* I stayed until January. An individual apartment that I had originally wanted and applied for way before I took the apartment with my friends opened and I took they opportunity because 1) They said they were fine with it and 2) They needed room for the baby\n* During my stay, the girl had a job some of the time, I had a job the entire time, and the guy didn't have a job because he played baseball at the university.\n*Also during my stay I paid for cable/internet to be installed and paid all of the cable/internet bills. They were ~$100/month. They paid for utilities (~$50 or less/month) and did give me some food from time to time. (They had food stamps). \n* I told them when I moved out if they need help, to ask me.\n* Found out today when checking about the deposit, they claim they had to pay $400 to clean the apartment (which was already pretty spiffy, just a few carpet stains), $100 for cleaning supplies, and the guy had to sell his car to make ends meet. \n\nWhat do I do in this situation? I'm in a bind where I need my money back. I also don't want to be a dick and make them pay me back. I don't know what to do.\n\nSummary: Former roommates took my returned security deposit. What do I do?\n\nFeedback: The summary is quite correct but should mention that the original poster is asking for advice on how to manage the situation of nedding his money back but not wanting to be a dick by asking it. \n\nTL;DR",

I remember I was always tired and i can't breath properly so my mother took me to the ospital. We found out that my heart was larger than normal, they put me on transplant list and 3 weeks later there was an heart available for me.\nNow I'm 23 and I almost spent the majority of my life with a new heart. I'm grateful for that, but sometimes i feel like it's an heavy bag on my shoulders. Sometimes I feel guilty, because when i was sick i prayed for a new heart (and it means that i prayed that a child would die to take me alive).\nSometimes I just feel \"normal\" and then reality comes back and hit me in my face with a new complication (my medication take me alive but they have a lot of side effects)\nI don't plan my life, I just live it day by day, knowing that one of this days my doctors can tell me some bad news.\nIf i must describe what i feel, it will be a mix of angriness, resignation and a little bit of fear, knowing that life took my innocence away when i was a kid.\nSorry for my bad english but I'm italian\n\nSummary: The author reflects on their experience as a heart transplant recipient.

Nontheless, as soon as I got my head on straight I ended it. It was never 'healthy' and I was just confused. He was in a bad place in his marriage and enjoyed talking to me and misinterpreted friendship for something more and went after it. I, being young and just not in a very good place, was curious and gave in. We hooked up for a few months and I really hated the person I was becoming. I ended it and he did not take it so well. Its been 5 months since I told him I was not interested in anything but a professional relationship with him. And he still has not accepted no for an answer. He emails me and begs me to reconsider and give him a real shot one day. That he will wait for me. I'm not sure how to make myself more clear. He says he needs to talk to me and get closure. That he has things he needs to say to me that he's kept bottled up for the last few months and needs to get off his chest. I told him that he wouldn't find the closure he needs by talking to me. That he really should talk to a therapist or a professional because I am not qualified to deal with this. He has this delusional idea that he's in love with me and claims we are soul mates.

Something has changed and I don't know how to handle it...\n\nText: I can't go into too many personal details because he is a Redditor and I don't want to chance that he'll see this. (I doubt he'd go on this subreddit, but I'd rather be safe than sorry).\n\nBasically, we're both in our mid 20's. We've been together for 4.5 years. He has been all I've ever wanted pretty much since we first met about 7 years ago. We have had our fair share of arguments, but we always work them out. However, this past April it was, honest to god, like a light switch went off, and I just don't feel that \"connection\" that I used to. I don't \"care\" enough to try to work out any of the little arguments we have. He hasn't done anything different...I can't explain it at all and it really scares me that one day it's fine, and the next day my feelings are just gone. Since then I've been trying to give it time to see if maybe I'm just going through a sort of \"depression\" phase and maybe this will go away, but it is not getting any better. I don't feel like cuddling or being close any more, and he definitely knows something is up because he's been asking \"why don't you want to cuddle anymore...why don't you love me anymore\" (he's not saying it seriously, almost jokingly, but I can tell he knows something is off). And it kills me because even just the thought of hurting him makes me cry, and part of me doesn't want to leave him because I really do still care about him just as much as I always have.\n\nI wouldn't know where to even start with bringing all of this up to him...(what to say, what my reasoning would be). Does anyone have any suggestions or advice to give? I'm just desperately lost and confused.\n\nSummary: I don't feel the same connection to my partner that I used to and it scares me.

I apologize if this post is kind of all over the place, but trying to quick explain the situation. \n\nMy FH and I are both military (LDR for 4 years) and stationed at different bases.  We have been talking marriage for over a year, planning on doing a simple backyard ceremony within the next year or two.  Fast forward to recent times, and he has gotten overseas orders, leaving in fall of this year.  I am unable to go with him unless we are married.  \n\nTo top it all off, I was recently deployed for 6 months, and at the end of my deployment, my FH deployed to a different area.  By the time he gets back (late spring) it will have been a year since we've seen each other. \n\nAnyway, after discussion, we have decided to get married before he goes overseas.  Then, either I can try to apply to get orders with him, or I will be eligible to go be with him after my contract is up next year. \n\nHe is coming to visit me after he gets back from his deployment, and we have been discussing doing a court house marriage at that time.  The problem with this, is that both of our families would not be able to make it at that time (both his dad and my grandma are dealing with serious illnesses at this time).  We do not want to disappoint our families by getting married without them, but we absolutely cannot wait on the marriage due to the military. \n\nSo now for the advice....would we be terrible people for eloping/doing a court house wedding by ourselves....but only announcing engagement to everyone at that time?  We would plan to do a backyard wedding in fall before he leaves so that our families would have time to plan and be there.  Would 3-4 months be enough time to plan a simple backyard ceremony/reception?  Anybody have experience with either elopment or backyard weddings?\n\nSummary: My FH and I are getting married before he goes overseas, but we're worried about disappointing our families.\n\nFeedback: The summary misses very important points of the original post. It should mention that both the oribinal poster and her FH are both military and that's one of the reasons why they have to rush their wedding. It is important too that the original poster is asking for advice about they having to rush their wedding and the posibility of dissapointing their families. \n\nTL;DR",

She bailed on going out on the Friday as she'd been out the night before but said she'd definitely see me this week.\n\nSo I asked her tuesday if she wanted to do something Wednesday and she again said maybe as she thought she already had plans with her friend. She then text me late yesterday afternoon to say she's busy.\n\nSo I went out with my best friend who works with her and he got the impression that she doesn't want to go out with me. She said she's going away to study abroad for a year in a few weeks and thinks I've forgotten and doesn't really want to get into a relationship. She had mentioned both of these things the night I got with her but she'd also said she didn't like one night stands so I have no idea what I was.\n\nHonestly I just can't quite understand why you'd say your up for going out with someone then do everything you can to avoid it. I'd begun to think she didn't want to as she wouldn't give me an idea when she could go out when I tried to ask her.\n\nJust looking for some advice on what to do next. I feel like she is attracted to me but doesn't want to get to deep into things. Should I just ask her if she doesn't actually want to see me or just stop trying to set stuff up with her and move on?\n\nSummary: A girl I know from high school is sending mixed messages about meeting up. I'm not sure what to do next.\n\nFeedback: The summary is good, but it should also point out that the woman is about to leave the country for a year. The author feels like she is attracted to him. The summary should also convey that the author is explicitly asking if he should ask her if she is actually interested or if he should just move on.\n\nTL;DR",

This maybe long... \n\nThis may sound irresponsible and I lose sleep over it, but about 3 months ago my lovely \"you have to pay for it yourself\" graduation present started to die.\n\n So, since I have a part-time job, while attending college full-time in a STEM degree, which eats all my time up I started looking around for a new car. The dealership my parents got their car at said they could help me. After a few days of back and forth they said they got a brand new 2014 car approved for me. Me being ignorant to my financial ability agreed, along with having a major influence from almost everyone in my family telling me to \"take it.\"\n\nWell, next summer I'm suppose to transfer out and I'll be in Uni, taking 40-60 hours a semester for the next 3 years. The only probelm with this is it will render me unable to afford my $300 a month car payment. My folks have said they would \"pay\" for it, but that's just about as reliable as Direct TV during a thunderstorm. \n\nI'm trying to be responsible and look into my options, but every chance I take I get told that I'm making a stupid decision. I have 6 more years of $300 monthly car payments that is going to be next to impossible. I've thought about dropping out and paying it off, but that throws everything off.\n\nSummary: Got a new car, can't afford it, car payments for next 6 years.\n\nFeedback: The summary should be much more elaborate and provide more details. It should further point out that his family encouraged him to pay for the car and promised to pay the bills if he couldn't but that he does not trust those statements. Lastly the summary should point out that the author will go to college and thus won't be able to afford the car. He is further asking for advice on what his options are.\n\nTL;DR",

(30/m and 27f)\n\nText: I've been dating this awesome chick since late June. The sexual chemistry is unbelievable. We are very open with our feelings, have the same sick sense of humor, and tend to both be athletic.\n\nSo the issue is that we have really lost ourselves. We both are addicted to hanging out with each other. We have both stopped or slowed down our workout regimen and gained weight. I think that the loss of our scheduled activities has caused us to both be a bit depressed.\n\nThe relationship has been moving quickly. She met my folks and I met her dad. We already say I love you to each other.\n\nShe has moments of distance that she attributes to missing her home and family. She has been in this city for about a year and has next to no friends. Im a bit of a workaholic and was a running addict before I met her, so I rarely see my friends.\n\nHere is the big one.. She wants to move back home, close to her family. She doesn't really the lack of her social network in this city and wants to be with her big circle back home.\n\nAfter the time I have spent with her, I think that this could potentially be someone that I could spend my life with. Ive dated around for a very long time. She certainly stands apart. I would move to be with her. She tells me that she wants me to move with her.\n\nThe moments of distance, when she is homesick, has kinda killed my self esteem. She says that as we hit new milestones, with out her understanding why, makes her miss home. She has mentioned that she wants to make a family close to home, so maybe that is it.\n\nI suggested a week without talking or texting, while she takes a trip home. That way we can both see where things lay.   Did I make a mistake here? Was this a good idea?\n\nSummary: The author is in a relationship with a woman who he thinks may be the one, but she has expressed a desire to move back home to be closer to her family.\n\nFeedback: The summary is accurate but it should mention that the author has proposed to take a break of talking for a week while she takes a trip home, to figure things out for themselves.

He's not a fan of playing with most the boys at school cos the play bad guys, and run around with fake guns.  He'd rather hang with the teachers or girls, and play their games.  Needless to say, the biggest boy in class has started picking on him.  The boys birthday is coming up, and he told my nephew he'd get a baby piece of cake, cos he's a baby.  On my sisters advice, he told him that's not nice, and to stop.  My brother-in-law and myself say he should just ignore him.  But now my sis doesn't know rather to have him go to party or not.  My nephew wants to, as long as he gets a big kid slice of cake.  I adore my little nephew and this breaks my heart, fighting urge to fly 2000 miles a kick a 5yr old.  In lieu of that, what's the best advice I can give him?\n\nSummary: A 4-year-old nephew is being teased at school for being a baby. His big birthday is coming up, and the biggest boy in his class has said he'll get a baby piece of cake.\n\nFeedback: The summary makes an untrue statement as it is not the original poster's nephew birthday the one that is coming up but the big boy's birthday. The summary does not mention neither that this big boy is the one that teases the writer's nephew. It is also important to mention that even if the nephew wants to attend the big boy's birthday party the family members do not know what advice to give him. \n\nTL;DR",

So far though, I do mostly filing, folding & bundling newsletters at the end of each season, some maintenance here and there. I want/need more experience using computer programs like MS Office and data entry. I've only gotten maybe a few handfuls of computer work in my pocket. The folks where I volunteer are wonderful and I would love it if I could work there. But they seem to have plenty of staff and hiring me is out of their purview. Most computer work is only allowed to the staff. Nothing against them, but I feel like I've wasted the past couple of years there on grunt work.\n\nBeyond typing up college papers on Word and making flyers on Publisher, I've got little practice in MS Office programs. Learning Excel, Acces, mail merge, etc. would be so useful. At a previous non-profit, I learned a bit of html using Wordpress to update their websites. That has withered from disuse. What kind of place can I apply to for office work where the employer wouldn't mind training me? Or are non-profits my only option? If the latter, are there specific kinds that will get me more office work? Mine is part gallery so they need more help outside of the office. Could I take classes somewhere, ideally free?\n\nSummary: Where can I find a job where I can learn office skills?\n\nFeedback: The summary is not very detailed and should further point out that the author has been working at a non-profit in the hopes of getting administrative skills, but feels like they have mostly been doing grunt work.

I didn't have an eBay account and created one that day and bought the item using my card -- processed by Paypal. \n\nA few days pass and I constantly check the tracking information as my package gets closer and closer to my city. Finally, it's out for delivery. I leave the apartment to go to work and decide to check the mail once I get home.\n\nSo there I am, 1:30 AM, and no package. \n\nI was upset. I was so sure that the tracking said it was out for delivery before I went to work at 4:00 PM so it should be there, but it wasn't. I checked for a claim slip in case the package didn't fit in my box at the complex and I had to pick it up at the post office, but no, nothing.\n\nI went home and checked tracking again to see what happened, and there it was, \"Undeliverable as Address\".\n\nI grew even more upset because they were here. They had to have been here while I was out for them to know that it was undeliverable here. \n\nThen, as I'm cursing the seller and the shipper, I notice something wrong with my shipping address on eBay. I didn't add my apartment number. Why... why did I do that? It was in my billing address, but for some reason I didn't put it in my shipping address. Just... dammit.\n\nI've messaged the seller, created a case on eBay, and even messaged the post office, but nothing. No one seems to have any idea where my package went. It should have returned to the seller, but he hasn't said anything except sent me the tracking information.\n\nIt's now been two weeks, and nothing. Still.\n\nSummary: The author's eBay purchase was delivered to the wrong address because he failed to include his apartment number in the shipping information. He has contacted the seller and the post office but has not had any luck finding his package.\n\nFeedback: The summary makes an untrue statement as the package was not delivered to the wrong address, it was not delivered at all. \n\nTL;DR",

What do I do?\n\nText: A while ago my Dad asked me to use the laptop to print something out for him for work. I didn't know what the website it was on was called so I just went into the history to find it there. There were a few porn sites like Pornhub, YouPorn etc there, but that didn't bother me. My Dad works nights a lot so he regularly takes the laptop with him, so I just assumed he would visit the sites then. There were also some of those \"HOT SINGLES IN YOUR AREA!!\" type things but I thought they were just some of those crappy ads that redirect you on porn sites. I deleted the history just in case it ever came up in the search box while other people were around, and I forgot about it until today. A family friend's computer is broken so she asked to come around later to use ours to print something out. I said sure, and checked the history just in case, but I found a massive list of cheating sites visited a week ago. There must have been about 11 or 12 different sited visited one after the other, sites like Ashley Madison, Easysex, along a load of others with names like \"MILFbang\" and \"Localfuck\". There's no way that this many sites could be the result of some scummy ads. I deleted the history again, but I now wish I'd at least taken a screenshot first. I k ow this must be my Dad because I don't use the laptop unless I have to do something for a family member (I use my phone for Reddit, YouTube etc), I've never seen my Mum even touch the laptop because she's even more tech illiterate than my dog, and my Sister doesn't even live with us anymore. They've been together for 28 years, and the've always seemed pretty happy to me. They were thinking about getting a divorce a about 5 years ago, but I don't know what that was about, they decided to give it another chance and they've been fine ever since. I don't know what to do, any advice would be really helpful.\n\nSummary: Son thinks father is cheating on mother and doesn't know what to do.\n\nFeedback: The summary is accurate but misses some important information. The summary should mention that the author thinks that his father is cheating because of the browser history of his father on cheating web-pages. It is also important that his parents relationship has been a long lasting one. \n\nTL;DR",

He treats her like absolute shit, but I guess that's besides the point. She said she's not sure about dating, although she admitted to being attracted to me, and maybe considering dating me in the future. \n\nI told her I couldn't wait around for her and that I also couldn't just be friends. We decided to keep it friendly with the understanding that I'm still attracted to her, we're not going to hang out one-on-one anymore, and I'm going to pursue other women.\n\nSo I was quite distraught for a couple days (I had basically become deeply infatuated with her over the course of a week.), then I started calming down, got my groove back and nabbed three dates for this weekend. \n\nSo earlier today she texted me and asked what I was doing on the weekend. I told her I had some dates. She immediately seemed to get distant and cold, then admitted \"I'm a little jealous.\" In her words.\n\nI'm really hopeless when it comes to relationships and I'd love some help figuring this out. What is my best move here? I know I have three dates, but to be honest I'm still much more interested in her. She's a much higher caliber woman in every way than the dates I have lined up, and I have endless fun when I'm with her.\n\nWhat I DO know is that no matter what I'm going to go on my dates this weekend. What I'm not sure is how to deal with this girl. Even now that my infatuation has faded somewhat she remains one of the most beautiful, intelligent and interesting women I've ever met and I would be very glad to at least have the opportunity to date her and see how it works.\n\nI appreciate any comments and help in this matter.\n\nSummary: Met a girl, dated her, got friendzoned, still attracted to her. What should I do?\n\nFeedback: The summary does not convey the important parts of the text. It should mention that they agreed to not continue dating, upon which the author planned 3 dates with other woman. When the initial girl learned about that she was jealous.

The other night we had the 'dating history' talk that seems to pop up when relationships start getting serious.  After I briefed her on my (admittedly meager) tally of sexual partners, I expected to hear something close to my own experience (she's 21).  Instead she dropped a number that I didn't expect, given what I know about her.  Not quite double-digits but on the margins.  I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since, and it's driving me crazy.  It's not an extremely high number and I like to think I'm open-minded about sex, but the fact that this has been consuming me makes me realize how many hang-ups I still have.\n\nSo, Reddit, what in your partner's sexual/dating history makes you uncomfortable or upset?

And has anyone been in a relationship where you've lived in blissful ignorance of your partner's past?\n\nSummary: A person's sexual history can make you uncomfortable or upset, depending on your personal preferences.\n\nFeedback: This summary should mention that the original poster feels uncomfortable about the amount of sexual partners that his girlfriend previously had, as this amount was much higher than what he expected.

Wife [30F] not happy.\n\nText: I'll be honest. This wedding has been in the making for the last year, and the trip I want to go on is sort of last minute. I've never formally agreed to go to the wedding, but realistically it's always just been accepted as a given that I would be at the wedding since it is my wife's sister. \n\nOne of my college buddies just recently told our group of friends that he's going to Australia in October for business but plans to spend an extra week there just kicking around and exploring. One thing lead to another and two friends from our group decided to join him. I've wanted to go to Australia ever since I was in college, but I never could get a group together. It looks like that's finally happening! The problem is that I'll have to miss my sister-in-law's wedding because it falls right in the middle of the week we're planning to go, and it wouldn't make sense to leave early or go late. It's an expensive trip, but I can make it work. I think it would be money well spent. \n\nOf course my wife is not happy about this, which I can understand. She's very close to her sister, so I can see why the wedding is a big deal to her, but I don't think she really understands my position. I like her sister, but we're not close. The same is true for her fiance. I have nothing against them, but the only reason I would be going is for my wife. Normally, I'd be okay accepting this, but I have a chance to go on an awesome trip with good friends that I don't get to hang out with that often. I think I'm justified in wanting to go and am being both reasonable and fair.\n\nSummary: My wife's sister is getting married and I want to go on a trip to Australia with my friends, but I'll have to miss the wedding. My wife is not happy about this.\n\nFeedback: This summary is good overall, but it should mention that the wedding was planed a long time ago and the trip was just a last minute plan. It is also important that the trip to Australia is something that the author of the post has always wanted to do. \n\nTL;DR",

After that the author decided to fix it at home due to the high price that stores are asking for the repair. \n\nTL;DR",

This was performed at a rural hospital, and poorly apparently. They told her that during the surgery, they accidentally nicked an artery or vein, and had trouble stopping the bleeding. The surgeon at the time told her that she had to use very large sutures, and following, she had bleeding for at least a couple weeks. Ever since then, she has had irregular bowel movements - in that, she is often constipated for days. Presently, she does show some signs of potential gall bladder issues, but the symptoms in question predate this by years. She has been dealing with abdominal pain and constipation since the surgery. I am wondering if it's possible that this surgical mishap could have cut off some blood flow to the intestines or some other part of the excretory system resulting in the symptoms... but researching this has been difficult. I understand medical terms, but my searches have mostly turned up home remedies for constipation. She has taken stool softener to minor effect, and magnesium citrate to almost no effect. Any ideas are appreciated.\n\nThere is a long history as to why she hasn't pursued the matter previously, but it's beyond the scope of the issue at hand.\n\nSummary: A woman has had abdominal pain and constipation since a surgery 10 years ago, and is wondering if the surgery could have caused this.\n\nFeedback: This summary is quite good overall but should mention that the surgery was poorly done with some complications. Lastly the summary should also convery that the author is asking for advice on how to deal with her pain. \n\nTL;DR",

Help me, Reddit.\n\nText: My little girl was born 7 1/2 weeks early (which was also six weeks past the age cutoff for our school district).\n\nAfter two weeks in the nicu and a month on heart/lung monitors at home, she completely caught up and surpassed pretty much every growth metric for actual age (forget about adjusted!).\nNow, at 4 1/2 she's reading books designed for late first-grade and doing late-kindergarten math, mostly just on her own volition.\n\nWe've been terrified for a while of her having to wait an entire year for her to start kindergarten because she'd probably end up a huge discipline problem and start-off her entire school experience on a terrible foot.\n\nAfter months of looking, we finally found a private school willing to bend the rules for her and that we can afford.  Once she's through kindergarten, she'll be set for public school and we're off from there.\n\nSo, aside from my huge sigh of relief, I desperately want to give her something on her first day of kindergarten to show her how proud and hopelessly attached to her I am.\n\nBut, I'm drawing a blank.  I've thought about jewelry, but what can I find that would withstand a kid that young and be something she'd want to keep as she gets older?\n\nHelp me, reddit!  You're my only hope.\n\nSummary: A mother seeks a gift for her daughter's first day of kindergarten. She is worried that her daughter is too advanced for kindergarten and has found a private school that will allow her to start early.\n\nFeedback: The second sentence of this summary does not make sense. The summary should point out that the mother is asking for advice on what kind of gift she could give her daughter, it should be something that she would keep as she gets older. Also the summary should point out that the gift is a symbol for how proud the mother is that her child could already join kindergarten even though she is actually too young.\n\nTL;DR",

Do I have to answer this?\n\nText: My boyfriend asked me today how many guys I've slept with in the past. I know that I am the more experienced of the two of us and I really don't want to tell him. I think he's slept with two women and while I love him and love the sex we have, he isn't as great as previous partners and I'm afraid he'll start to compare himself. I've had about five partners, seven if we're not just counting actual penetration. They've all been in serious relationships and one a marriage. I don't feel like this makes me a whore but I'm afraid he will view it that way. I feel like this is a normal number for a guy but maybe a little high for a woman? Should I just lie?\n\nSummary: Boyfriend (M/33) of seven months asked me how many guys I've (F/34) slept with. Do I have to answer this?\n\nFeedback: The summary misses many details about the original text. The summary should mention that the original poster is afraid about his partner seeing her like a whore for having slept with more people than him. Apart from that, she doesn't want her boyfriend to compare himself with her previous sexual partners because he is not as good as them. \n\nTL;DR",

Things got a bit strange there, as we held hands together and she grabbed me and hugged me on a couple of rides. After the theme park she goes, \"omg thanks for the best theme park trip ever <3 :).\" The next day she asked me to go to some youth thing her church is having. I said sure and she went on and on about how \"this meant a whole lot to her\" and how \"we're gonna have a great time :).\" I thought it was gonna be fun too, but at the actual thing she left me alone to my own devices, with total strangers (I wasn't sure about going for THIS EXACT REASON.) The next day was worse... She brought another guy with her and not only did she ignore me and ditch me again, she started getting all touchy-feely with this guy. Gee, I can see how much my presence means to her... I know we aren't actually dating yet or anything but man, that sucked big time to see her like that. I am contemplating not going anymore (its a week-long event) but the discussions and \"sermons\" are actually enlightening and to not go would basically ignore the teachings of said sermons - but I don't know if I really would enjoy seeing her like this and what effect it will have on my feelings in the long run (so far I feel hurt and neglected...)\n\nSummary: Girl invites guy to church youth event, guy gets ignored and ditched by girl, guy is contemplating not going to the event anymore.\n\nFeedback: The summary is quite correct but misses some important points. The summary should mention that before the church youth event the original poster and the girl already had a wonderful time. It is also important that the author was upset because the girl was feely with another guy during the church youth. \n\nTL;DR",

He says he will stay for 2 years or so and then come back to be with me. He also says he's dedicated to me and that he won't let the distance ruin our relationship.\n\nWhile I believe truly that he means these things, I've been roughed up around the edges before about loves lost and have a failed long-distance relationship in my past.  I am having a huge amount of trouble accepting that our relationship can last.  He says my negativity is getting him down about it, and that if anything will ruin it, it will be my wet blanket.\n\nRedditors, can it work? Please share some positive helpful stories about long-distance that's really turned out for the best. I hear so much that goes wrong, and have had bad experiences. I need to channel a better outlook about this!\n\nSummary: Girlfriend is skeptical about long-distance relationship working, needs some positive encouragement.\n\nFeedback: This summary is good overall, but it should mention that original poster's boyfriend is dedicated to the relationship even if the worries coming from the girl are getting him down. \n\nTL;DR",

Neither of us were happy in the relationship, but I told her I didn't want to be friendly going forward and basically never wanted to see or hear from her again. This is complicated by the fact that we live in the same neighborhood, went to college together and share some common acquaintances.\n\nEven though breaking up was very hard on me, I also stupidly followed through on a macho impulse to act as though it didn't particularly bother me at the time and, when she asked me how I was so calm, told her that it just felt better now that we had made a decision.\n\nSo, I think this adds up to me having been a jackass. And I really regret it because I have no end of respect for this woman. I've thought on and off about reaching out to apologize because it seems like the right thing to do, but I don't want to weird her out now 6 months out from breaking up.\n\n I have no desire to get back together with her, nor do I think she'd be interested in dating me again. However, I'd love for us to be on decent terms and feel like I probably messed that up. \n\nWhat do you all think? Better late than never or better never than late for this kind of thing?\n\nSummary: Ex-gf and I broke up 6 months ago, I was an immature jackass about it and now I regret it. Should I reach out to apologize?\n\nFeedback: The summary is good overall. The summary should, however, provide more details on what is meant by an \"inmature jackass\". Concretely the summary should say that the author acted macho like and said he never wanted to see her again. Lastly the author is actually asking if he should apologise now, 6 months later, or better let this go.\n\nTL;DR",

We've said the \"i love you\"s and have awesome times together.\n\nMy main problem is that she is very independent and it leaves me feeling uncared for. For example, today we had lunch plans. I texted her a reminder and she said she already ate because she was hungry but that i could meet her at the library to hang out a bit. I feel fed up because many times she has set up a date only to cancel it or change it without seeming to think of me. \n\nI believe she isnt doing it purposefully and is just self focused. Still, i feel like im constantly stressed about our relationship and cant get a good read on what she is feeling. I want to get through to her but when i try to talk about our relarionship i just feel like im spoiling the mood. My question is: should i just accept this as part of her? Or is it worth fighting about? I consistently feel neglected but i know she loves me. Maybe im just too emotionally dependent.\n\nSummary: Boyfriend is stressed about girlfriend's independence and lack of consideration for him.

I was zoned out for a bit and when I zoned back in the first thing I heard was the phrase,\" Why did she tell her father she was a prostitue,' and the inner twelve year old in me blurted out,\" Family Discount?\" \n\nNow keep in mind that I said this very quietly and carefully so only my peers heard it. But them my dumb ass of a friend decided it was to funny to not repeat so he yelled for the whole class to hear,\" Family discount.\" Then of course the teacher heard. So when my friend was confronted by the teacher he told her that I was the one who originally said it like the dumb ass he is. Needless to say both of us have detention for a week and I am grounded from my computer for a month.\n\nSummary: I got detention for a week and am grounded from my computer for a month because my friend repeated something I said quietly in class.\n\nFeedback: The summary is correct but should mention that both the original poster and his friend got detention due to the joke. \n\nTL;DR",

I've only recently begun to develop feelings for her, but it's been quite obvious to me for some time that she has had and now shares those feelings. I've really been trying to hide my feelings though because she; however, is in what her family, friends, and I call a terrible relationship. \n\nShe no longer has any guy friends left because they were all scared off by this guy and she's trying her hardest to keep the fact that she's been talking to and hanging out with me on the regular a secret because she's afraid that he'll harass me or try and hurt me. \n\nHer sister and I are also starting to get concerned that the relationship  might become physically abusive. I would like to specify that at this point it is only to the, best of my and her families knowledge, a verbally argumentative relationship, but she's told me it's been getting worse recently. And they have been dating for 6 months.\n\nI've never really been one to ask for advice, but I don't know if I should continue being passive and deal with the problems as they come or if I should just put myself out there? I'm just afraid if I do that I'll risk pushing her away and losing someone I consider to be my best friend. \n\nThat's my conflict, I just want to know what you think and if I should do anything at all, I know this is a rather small bit of information to go on so any advice at all would be helpful.\n\nThanks\n\nSummary: Should the protagonist tell their best friend that they have feelings for her, despite her being in a verbally abusive relationship?\n\nFeedback: The summary is accurate but should mention should mention that the friend also has feelings for the author even if she is already in a relationship.

t3_4klykf,"Hello all, so the other day I read a post about using MFP to track food and just linking it to a Fitbit so I figured I would give it a shot since everyone loves MFP so much.

t3_l6xcu,"6 days ago I was on a gentle bike ride (along a tar road, no hills or anything). We had just reached the point of the ride where we were going to take a 5 minute break, eat some sandwiches and begin the return leg back to our car when I sat down and felt a 'twinge' in my lower back.

 I commented to my buddy about the twinge, and then maybe 1 minute later I experienced the most intense pain I have ever felt. It felt like someone had snuck up behind me and thrust a long thin knife into my spine. I collapsed on the ground, with my lower back screaming in pain and my lower body feeling all strange, kinda tingly (more on the right hand side than the left, especially down my right leg). 

It took 2 and a half hours to return to our car (a trip which should have taken 15 minutes). The pain got worse and worse and I could hardly move from it- it felt like a crazy war movie scene with an injured guy begging to be put out of his misery, just trying to push my bike back to the car. My buddy drove me home, where I just managed to unlock my apartment and collapse onto the floor, where I stayed with minor adjustments for the last 5 days. The pain has gradually reduced, but I still feel ""broken"" in my back- If there is weight on my lower back it really hurts. As Im typing this Im holding my weight on my forearms on my desk.

I missed 3 days of work, and am just now back in the office. I scheduled an appointment with a physiotherapist this afternoon, but am not sure what else to do. (This is my first appointment- I could literally not leave the floor for the past 5 days, not even for the toilet, funfun)

And then, a few days after that conversation, I got really, way too drunk and made out with one of our mutual friends. Hoo boy. While this mutual friend and I talked and agreed it was a stupid mistake that we didn't want to repeat, my friend (rightfully so) became very hurt. She went home for the weekend and we stopped talking, but she came back basically saying that she didn't want to cut me out of her life, but that I had really broken her trust, I would have to build that back up, and that our friendship would never really be the same.

I guess at this point I'd just like to know if anyone has any advice for what to do from here; I'd like to prove to her that I do really care about her and build that trust back up. I really do feel awful about this all. Anyone been in a situation like this? What did you do/what did you learn from it?

What should I do now?",This summary is really great. The only thing that should be added is the fact that the author acknowledges that he deserves all of it and that he is asking if anybody else has been in such a situation.

I felt like we really bonded over this. He was really cool and incredibly helpful, funny, and smart to boot! Although he went to a private schools, he's very open-minded about civil rights issues, we have similar political affiliations, watch the same TV shows, and he isn't ashamed to like musicals.

My main problem is that I've had a history of horrible relationships. Not even horrible in the way most people think. I feel like there's a very strong chance I'm asexual.

I'm not socially awkward, but I am fairly introverted. It's not that I don't like to talk, I just don't usually talk unless I have something to say. That aside, women never talk to me first nor can they keep a conversation going. Even in group discussions in class, usually only the guys will discuss the topic with me. 

Here's the bizarre thing, I have a TON of gay friends that hit on me all the time. Why are the men so forward and confident, but women are all shy or uncomfortable / anxious around me? Tbh, I have the same amount of close gay friends as I have close straight guy friends. And obviously that ratio is pretty lopsided. And literally only women that I'm not very attracted to will try to be friends with me and they're always way cooler than most above average looking women(from my perspective). It's like there's some kind of tension there when I'm around attractive women. I don't know if it's what I say, or if I put off bad vibes, but it's usually only around attractive women. It's like even if I'm actually trying to hold a conversation, they don't contribute.

My luck has been bad enough to where I had sexual relations one time with my only best female friend and she has avoided hanging out with me ever since. I'm not sure what the problem was because we were pretty close. She didn't even give anything a chance, but I suspect this had to do with her relatively recent breakup.

Every women I've been with or been ""talking"" has said I'm too attractive for them. Idk if that's even related, but it's like they think they aren't good enough for me when I try to become more than friends. Sometimes I think how much easier it'd be if I was gay lol.

t3_1wsx0h,"Hi Reddit, I need your help!

Just a few weeks ago I met this guy(m/23) and we had this 'click' right from the start. I was at a small party and I met him there. I was the youngest, I knew, everyone called me a 'jailbait' so I knew everyone was at least 1 or 2 years older than me.

I had come there because a good girl friend of mine(f/20) asked me to come, and said it would be fun. I didn't want to go at first, but she begged me to, so I thought I'd just go to make her happy.

The guy I met and I talked for hours straight. When the party was over and I was back home again, we continued whatsapping, facebooking and skyping for hours nonstop. We have so much in common - we say the same things at the same time, we feel the same way about basically everything!

Now, I have two problems here. First one is, that the girl that wanted me to come to the party, is a lesbian, I never thought anything of it - but apparently she's fallen in love with me. She is one of my closest friends. How do I politely tell her that I'm not going to date her? She's pushing me into it, I've been with a girl once for 4 months or so, but she knows that I'm not into girls anymore, but I guess she thinks she can force me into becoming a lesbian. At least, that's what it feels like.

Second, I really like the guy. I found out he was 23 later because he was ashamed of his age at first. We didn't really mention it at first because we just didn't think about it - we all knew I'm a 'jailbait' and I knew he had to be at least 18 or older, apparently our age difference is 6 years. I'm stressing over it. 

For Valentines day he's going to take me out. I'm really excited for it and if we have the same click again, I think we will become a couple. Just...

Title: tifu by driving in the rain for the first time

Text: It rained!!! (Guess where I'm from) I got my drivers permit about 2 months ago, bought a car two weeks later with my hard earned money from the summer. The car was shitty to others but a full blown race car to me. Looked like crap but ran like a champ. Anyways, I have never driven in the rain so I knew I'll run into trouble on my way back home from work. Hydro planing sounded familiar to me but never knew it's real consequences.

TL;DR","In the text, the author tells the story of how they hydroplaned for the first time and crashed their car. Despite the negative experience, they learned a lot and are now looking to sell their car.","The first sentence of the summary is good, but the second sentence is wrong and should be removed. The summary should mention how the car broke because of the crash and that the author is angry about this and has to sell the car. Lastly it could mention that a trucker helped him push the car out of the water."

t3_2blhi2,"I have a problem with running and am hoping to hear that my problem is fairly common and that there's an easy solution. I'm not sure. 

I am currently training for my first half- and full-marathons, in Chicago this September and October. I have been running consistently for the last few months.

1. Switched time of day that I run: I was running late mornings, early afternoons. During my trip, I had to shift to the early mornings. I figure this was needed anyway, since the half and full marathons are morning runs.

3. Stress due to travel? This was all in the northern midwest, though, so I wasn't grappling with significant climate or elevation changes.

Title: She [17F] likes me [17M] back but her best friend also likes me :\

Text: For the past few months, this girl (Girl 1) I go to high school with has been flirting with me and things have been going pretty well. Recently, she told her best friend (Girl 2) that she likes me and how she wants to be with me etc. 

Well, it turns out Girl 2 started liking me a little while before she found out that Girl 1 and I have been flirting for the past few months. Being the good friend that she is, Girl 2 decided to keep quiet about liking me because she didn't want to ruin/get in between me and Girl 1.

I'm stuck in the middle of all this and I don't know if i should back off or if I should still have hope in this entire situation.

TL;DR",Girl 1 and Girl 2 are high school friends. Girl 1 has been flirting with the protagonist (17M) for a few months and recently told Girl 2 that she likes him.,This summary does not convey the important part of the text. The summary should point out that Girl 2 also has a crush on the protagonist and that Girl 2 has told Girl 1. Since Girl 1 does not want to ruin the relationship with Girl 2 she has become distant with the protagonist. Girl 2 though encourages Girl 1 not to give up on this relationship. The author is wondering if he should back off or if he should still have hope.

1. A 10 page term paper that was required to include 10 sources (2 of which from actual books and not the internet) in APA style format. 

2. A 2 week nutrition diary that i had to include times of day and the calories that each item had, which of course i completely bullshitted.

3. A 6 page research paper of our choice with 10 sources MLA style

4. (Because I'm studying exercise science) A Detailed workout regiment of at least 3 times per week that i have done and what affect they have plus the duration/rep count/intensity/sets.

5. Practice and conditioning for baseball - trust me this does eat up a lot of god damn time, plus the time it takes to get ready, get to the field, and to shower afterwards.

6. Actually going to class - I'm going to throw this in there because it did eat up a good portion of the time i could have been working on the work mentioned above.

Again, this may not sound like a lot, but each of these activities were very time consuming and it took many energy drinks, a sleepless night,  and a damn good amount of motivation to complete aka not getting on Reddit. Also i had to turn down all my friends that wanted to hang out.

Title: I am a [18 M] she is a [17 F] and I don't know how to read this relationship?

Text: We've known each other through school but never talked until we had a class together. I asked her out after about a week, we went out for food, laughed, flirted etc etc. I asked her out again same situation, everything going great. Now it's three weeks later (midst of exams) and I'm starting to get the feeling that she's not thinking of this as a ""relationship"" in the conventional bf/gf sense. I'm new to the whole dating game and wondering a few things. 

Do I need to ask if we're together as bf/gf or is that implied by asking her out multiple times? Should I straight up ask if she likes me the way I like her? I know what the friend zone is and I'm not feeling there, yet, but we're having a movie night tomorrow just her and I. I plan on seeing what's what then by trying to get physical, not hardcore, just simple stuff like leg touches, cuddling etc. Oh and finally, to add to my lengthy situation, On our third ""date"" (studying for an exam) I drove her home and attempted to kiss her but got the infamous cheek. I didn't make a big deal about it I just moved past said ""got your things?"" and politely said goodbye preceding to wait for her to get inside her house. I've been told I shouldn't fret about ONE kiss rejection cause there could be multiple reasons for it but at the same time that made me think more about the friend zone possibility. 

Any advice or similar situations and how you solved the problem would be smashing! Thanks in advance.

TL;DR",A guy is trying to figure out if he's in a relationship with a girl and if she likes him back. He's also trying to figure out if he should ask her out again and if he should try to kiss her.,"The first sentence of this summary is correct, the second one is inaccurate though. The summary should point out that the author is asking if he should just ask the girl what their relationshp is.

Title: I'm [20/F] and my (ex?) is [19/M]. We were once considered an official, but not a public couple.

Text: I talked to this guy online i liked for a little while, but eventually we find that we need to take the same classes at the University. We eventually moved in together, expecting nothing to happen. However, a kiss happened, and a lot of cuddling/relationship talk happened. We rocked back and forth from making the relationship ""a summer thing"" and carrying it on into the school year. We eventually agreed that it would carry on into the school year, but take it slow because he didn't want to be in a relationship just yet. We sneak out and cuddle and whatnot the second night, but it seems as though another girl liked him as well. She likes him, and I like him, but from what he says, he only likes me and does not like her. One night he tells me he is sleeping, but I find that he's in the room with that girl, alone. He sleeps over, and tells me nothing. He doesn't seem to tell me until i asked him, and I accept his apology, but am hurt because he lied/avoided the question. Now we've talked and somewhat agreed that we should take a break, but I'm really vulnerable. I tell him that he can hang out with her because she doesn't know we were once in a relationship, but it hurts me a lot to see them together. I want to be/stay in the relationship with him, but it seems he doesn't want to, and I will have to get over it. Now i'm stuck deciding whether or not I want to keep the feelings i have for him and hope that he will still like me or get over her and just watch her be alone with him all the time.

TL;DR","A girl and guy were in a relationship, but broke up. The guy is now hanging out with another girl, and the girl is deciding whether or not to stay in the relationship.",This summary is quite correct but should mention some other important points of the original post. The summary should mention that while they were taking their relationship slowly the guy slept with another girl and they took a break after that. The original poster is now unsure about moving on or not.

He tells me the story of how he got the number for each girl individually. By the third girl it's getting old, but eh, I'm his friend, so I'll sit and listen. He then proceeds to tell this same story to ALL our other friends, making everybody hear the story like 3 times.

Hopefully this is the appropriate subreddit for this matter (and if it isn't just tell me where to go!)

Today, I found out that I am going to be a father! I'm so looking forward to the new year :)
This post is more ""me centered"", just to let you know.

My situation is a little unusual because I am a transgender man (meaning I was born a girl).
...So with that, I have no ability to impregnate my wife (or anyone for that matter). My brother was willing to be a donor for when we felt the time was right. 
After going through legal details and lots of medical testing, My wife is now 5 weeks pregnant!

We are ages 27 & 28, 4 years married (So close to 5!), financially stable, recently moved from our apartment into a house. 

We are so thrilled to start a family. Late nights and long talks about parenting have brought out lots of details and plans. Of course we talked about my gender identity and what aspects of it could effect our child, Positive and Negative. We feel a bit stuck.
(We both agree that being honest to our child is important)

I'm just worried about their future. What if I don't explain things right. 
The facts are that:
dad is transgender, doesn't have boy parts (even though he is hairy, sounds like a boy and doesn't have a chest), dad can't have babies... so .... obviously.

Along with trying not to confuse my child, I'm concerned for our safety. 
I am legally male and apart from my close friends, doctors and family, Nobody knows about my transition. 
So many bad things happen to transgender people, simply because they are trans. I've lived through a hate based attack, and since then I've been terrified of having people finding out. I now live in more accepting city, but I can never be to sure. 

Any input or advice you might have on the situation is greatly appreciated.

* We each paid $367.
* The girl in the couple was preggers at the time.

Title: Former roommates took my returned security deposit. What do I do?

Text: Hello Reddit. The problem in the title has been presented to me recently and I don't know how to approach it. Last August I was desperately looking for an apartment before college started and settled on moving in with two friends, who were a couple. Here's a breakdown I'll try to keep as unbiased as possible.

* We each paid $367.
* The girl in the couple was preggers at the time.
* I did not physically sign the lease because I had no means of transportation at the time. I sent them the money and they signed it. 
* The lease was for August through the end of April.
* I stayed until January. An individual apartment that I had originally wanted and applied for way before I took the apartment with my friends opened and I took they opportunity because 1) They said they were fine with it and 2) They needed room for the baby
* During my stay, the girl had a job some of the time, I had a job the entire time, and the guy didn't have a job because he played baseball at the university.
*Also during my stay I paid for cable/internet to be installed and paid all of the cable/internet bills. They were ~$100/month. They paid for utilities (~$50 or less/month) and did give me some food from time to time. (They had food stamps).

Fast forward to recent times, and he has gotten overseas orders, leaving in fall of this year.  I am unable to go with him unless we are married.  

To top it all off, I was recently deployed for 6 months, and at the end of my deployment, my FH deployed to a different area.  By the time he gets back (late spring) it will have been a year since we've seen each other. 

Anyway, after discussion, we have decided to get married before he goes overseas.  Then, either I can try to apply to get orders with him, or I will be eligible to go be with him after my contract is up next year. 

He is coming to visit me after he gets back from his deployment, and we have been discussing doing a court house marriage at that time.  The problem with this, is that both of our families would not be able to make it at that time (both his dad and my grandma are dealing with serious illnesses at this time).  We do not want to disappoint our families by getting married without them, but we absolutely cannot wait on the marriage due to the military.

Here is the big one.. She wants to move back home, close to her family. She doesn't really the lack of her social network in this city and wants to be with her big circle back home.

After the time I have spent with her, I think that this could potentially be someone that I could spend my life with. Ive dated around for a very long time. She certainly stands apart. I would move to be with her. She tells me that she wants me to move with her.

The moments of distance, when she is homesick, has kinda killed my self esteem. She says that as we hit new milestones, with out her understanding why, makes her miss home. She has mentioned that she wants to make a family close to home, so maybe that is it.

I suggested a week without talking or texting, while she takes a trip home. That way we can both see where things lay.   Did I make a mistake here? Was this a good idea?

TL;DR","The author is in a relationship with a woman who he thinks may be the one, but she has expressed a desire to move back home to be closer to her family.","The summary is accurate but it should mention that the author has proposed to take a break of talking for a week while she takes a trip home, to figure things out for themselves.

t3_2ad1mt,"This happened two weeks ago and I've been doing damage control since. 

I was looking to buy some hobby stuff and found something good and inexpensive on eBay. I didn't have an eBay account and created one that day and bought the item using my card -- processed by Paypal. 

A few days pass and I constantly check the tracking information as my package gets closer and closer to my city. Finally, it's out for delivery. I leave the apartment to go to work and decide to check the mail once I get home.

So there I am, 1:30 AM, and no package. 

I was upset. I was so sure that the tracking said it was out for delivery before I went to work at 4:00 PM so it should be there, but it wasn't. I checked for a claim slip in case the package didn't fit in my box at the complex and I had to pick it up at the post office, but no, nothing.

I went home and checked tracking again to see what happened, and there it was, ""Undeliverable as Address"".

I grew even more upset because they were here. They had to have been here while I was out for them to know that it was undeliverable here. 

Then, as I'm cursing the seller and the shipper, I notice something wrong with my shipping address on eBay. I didn't add my apartment number. Why... why did I do that? It was in my billing address, but for some reason I didn't put it in my shipping address. Just... dammit.

I've messaged the seller, created a case on eBay, and even messaged the post office, but nothing. No one seems to have any idea where my package went. It should have returned to the seller, but he hasn't said anything except sent me the tracking information.

So I was quite distraught for a couple days (I had basically become deeply infatuated with her over the course of a week.), then I started calming down, got my groove back and nabbed three dates for this weekend. 

So earlier today she texted me and asked what I was doing on the weekend. I told her I had some dates. She immediately seemed to get distant and cold, then admitted ""I'm a little jealous."" In her words.

I sent her a really sincere and honest text Monday about how it was my fault and I was insecure.  

I haven't spoke to her since but I realize what I lost and how it was my fault.  I was planning on texting her in two week just to see how she is and not make anything of it because I am actually leaving the country for a week.  

She said when we broke up she was upset that we lost what was so good at the beginning. I really want to show her I'm not that guy and I am really as laid back as she is. Is this a good idea or am I just grasping at straws?

TL;DR","The author describes a previous, short-term relationship in which he made a series of mistakes that led to the breakup.",The summary is accurate but should mention that the mistakes done by the actor were related with overracting to small things. The summary should also convey that the author is looking for advice on if he should contact her again or let things be.

Around 10 years ago, she had surgery to remove a cyst (I forget what it's called, but she explained it as basically a fetus that ends up growing as a cyst - we weren't together then, so that's the best I can do). This was performed at a rural hospital, and poorly apparently. They told her that during the surgery, they accidentally nicked an artery or vein, and had trouble stopping the bleeding.

Ever since then, she has had irregular bowel movements - in that, she is often constipated for days. Presently, she does show some signs of potential gall bladder issues, but the symptoms in question predate this by years. She has been dealing with abdominal pain and constipation since the surgery. I am wondering if it's possible that this surgical mishap could have cut off some blood flow to the intestines or some other part of the excretory system resulting in the symptoms... but researching this has been difficult.

Text: So this hapened literally yesterday so as I sit here on the toilet typing this I remember it like it was yesterday.

So in English we are reading a book and I was not paying very much attention. I was zoned out for a bit and when I zoned back in the first thing I heard was the phrase,"" Why did she tell her father she was a prostitue,' and the inner twelve year old in me blurted out,"" Family Discount?"" 

Now keep in mind that I said this very quietly and carefully so only my peers heard it. But them my dumb ass of a friend decided it was to funny to not repeat so he yelled for the whole class to hear,"" Family discount."" Then of course the teacher heard. So when my friend was confronted by the teacher he told her that I was the one who originally said it like the dumb ass he is. Needless to say both of us have detention for a week and I am grounded from my computer for a month.

TL;DR",I got detention for a week and am grounded from my computer for a month because my friend repeated something I said quietly in class.,The summary is correct but should mention that both the original poster and his friend got detention due to the joke. 
t3_w5n12,"I've known this girl, I myself am 20 and she is 19, for quite some time now and we became friends very quickly. I've only recently begun to develop feelings for her, but it's been quite obvious to me for some time that she has had and now shares those feelings. I've really been trying to hide my feelings though because she; however, is in what her family, friends, and I call a terrible relationship. 

She no longer has any guy friends left because they were all scared off by this guy and she's trying her hardest to keep the fact that she's been talking to and hanging out with me on the regular a secret because she's afraid that he'll harass me or try and hurt me. 

Her sister and I are also starting to get concerned that the relationship  might become physically abusive. I would like to specify that at this point it is only to the, best of my and her families knowledge, a verbally argumentative relationship, but she's told me it's been getting worse recently. And they have been dating for 6 months.

I've never really been one to ask for advice, but I don't know if I should continue being passive and deal with the problems as they come or if I should just put myself out there? I'm just afraid if I do that I'll risk pushing her away and losing someone I consider to be my best friend. 

That's my conflict, I just want to know what you think and if I should do anything at all, I know this is a rather small bit of information to go on so any advice at all would be helpful.

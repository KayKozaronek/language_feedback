One of these friends is a 25 year old guy from China.  \n\nBecause English was not his first language and I could tell he was a little isolated, I was careful to be nice and invite him to events.  We started hanging out some on our own, but mostly just to discuss school\/world politics; nothing too personal.  He asked me out a few times this fall, and even though I assumed he was single, I turned him down nicely-- just wasn't interested.\n\nAfter the final time I turned him down he got a little clingy and weird, so I tried to create some space between us; I didn't really speak to him over Christmas break.\n\nImagine my surprise when my presumably single friend comes home from China married after Christmas!  Turns out he'd had a girlfriend all along and they tied the knot while he was there.  I assumed that settled things, and went back to occasionally spending time with him.\n\nLast night, he admitted to me that he's jealous of the guy I've been dating and has feelings for me.  I sort of just apologized and ignored it, but now I'm frustrated and not sure what to do.  Normally, I would just cut things off with him since he doesn't seem to be able to have \"just friends\" feelings toward me.  In this case, though, I feel guilty, since he really doesn't have many friends and seems to put a lot of energy into maintaining contact with me.   So what should I do?  Just end things?  Pretend it never happened?  All I know is that I certainly wouldn't want MY husband spending time alone with a woman he had feelings for.  I don't want to cross any lines.\n\nTL;DR:","completion":" My friend from school who is now married is still in love with me and I don't know what to do about it."}

Before my boyfriend went to work in the morning we had a quickie, but that left me wanting more. All day yesterday I had been telling him he left my craving more and that I wanted him when he got home at night.\n\nSo the night came, we were cudding on the couch and I made my advance. It should not have come as a surprise because I had been telling him I wanted him all day. I started kissing him and rubbing on him, but I could tell he sort of wasn't into it. I don't know why but I got really frustrated, I stood up and told him \"Fine, I see you don't want to play, so I am just going to leave you alone.\"  I walked away for a few minutes and then I came to sit back down with him. At his point he had his head down and started crying. I felt really bad!\n\nI apologized and we talked. He has told me he is trying to take it slow because in his past relationships he always had a lot of sex and they ended up breaking his heart. He is somehow associating that if he has a lot of sex then the relationship will go sour. He has assured me he wants things to work out for the long haul and is serious about our relationship, I'm just trying to figure out this part.\n\nAnytime he approaches me when he is horny I am glad to satisfy him, but when I approached him last night I felt rebuffed.\n\nDid I overract? Should I try not approching him for a little while, like giving sex a break for a few days? \n\nHe is a very sensitive guy, and I know that already. I want to be considerate of his feelings.

I've been using my Fitbit with a fair amount of success since February and love it but I end up adding a lot of foods since they aren't in the database.\n\nMy problem is this: I linked MFP with Fitbit for steps and food and only logged my food in MFP like it told me to in 3 different places.

We had just reached the point of the ride where we were going to take a 5 minute break, eat some sandwiches and begin the return leg back to our car when I sat down and felt a 'twinge' in my lower back.\n\n I commented to my buddy about the twinge, and then maybe 1 minute later I experienced the most intense pain I have ever felt. It felt like someone had snuck up behind me and thrust a long thin knife into my spine. I collapsed on the ground, with my lower back screaming in pain and my lower body feeling all strange, kinda tingly (more on the right hand side than the left, especially down my right leg). \n\nIt took 2 and a half hours to return to our car (a trip which should have taken 15 minutes). The pain got worse and worse and I could hardly move from it- it felt like a crazy war movie scene with an injured guy begging to be put out of his misery, just trying to push my bike back to the car. My buddy drove me home, where I just managed to unlock my apartment and collapse onto the floor, where I stayed with minor adjustments for the last 5 days. The pain has gradually reduced, but I still feel \"broken\" in my back- If there is weight on my lower back it really hurts. As Im typing this Im holding my weight on my forearms on my desk.\n\nI missed 3 days of work, and am just now back in the office. I scheduled an appointment with a physiotherapist this afternoon, but am not sure what else to do. (This is my first appointment- I could literally not leave the floor for the past 5 days, not even for the toilet, funfun)\n\nIm a relativly heathy guy of 27, have had a history of back problems but *nothing* like what happened to me last week.\n\n Anyone got any ideas of what could have happened, what I should do, or anything else that would help me?\n\nTL;DR:","completion":" Sudden, intense back pain while on a bike ride leads to days of incapacitating pain.

We decided that there was some stuff I had to take care of first, but we were both into the idea and agreed to be platonic friends until we would (really inevitably at this point) start dating.\n\nAnd then, a few days after that conversation, I got really, way too drunk and made out with one of our mutual friends. Hoo boy. While this mutual friend and I talked and agreed it was a stupid mistake that we didn't want to repeat, my friend (rightfully so) became very hurt. She went home for the weekend and we stopped talking, but she came back basically saying that she didn't want to cut me out of her life, but that I had really broken her trust, I would have to build that back up, and that our friendship would never really be the same.\n\nHonestly, I deserve all of it - even though it really was a stupid mistake and I would never in my right mind intend to do something like this, the fact is that I did it anyways while drunk and really did fuck up.\n\nI don't know that there's much to do from here - while I'd really still like to date this friend, I can definitely see why that possibility could be off the table forever now.

I've been Cousin's guardian for two years now, and we're doing well.\n\nRecently, our grandmother (uncle's mother) has tried to get into contact with us again. I cut off a huge swathe of my family during the trial \u2013 essentially everyone who was not explicitly on our side \u2013 and my grandmother was part of that. Grandmother wants to make amends for her \"ambivalence,\" and that she is not talking to my uncle.\n\nCousin loves Grandmother and was upset when I cut contact with her, even when I explained the situation, and I want to do right by him.

I, in turn, enjoy trolling him back. Recently, he received a dare to post something serious to his facebook as part of a prank. The way the prank works is that if somebody messages you about the serious thing you posted, you are given something by them to post on your wall. The joke spreads around like that, and is sort of stupid in my opinion. A few days later, I see he has posted to his wall \"My Grandmother went to heaven today.\" With the odd wording, and me hearing nothing of his grandma's ill health, I assumed it was another one of his prank posts to lure more people in to his silly joke. I thought it would be rather funny to mess with some of the believers in the comments of the post.\n\nI type \"Good riddance\" into the comments and, within seconds, I receive a reply from one of his friends I did not know saying \"That's horrible. Why would you say something like that?\" With a lack of better judgement, I decide not to hold back. I go on a rant spreading lies about his grandmother: \"She was a horrible person and a menace to society\", \"She even ran over my cat and never apologized\", \"I went to AssHat's house and saw alot of German WWII related items.\", \"That monster was literally a nazi!\", \"She's scum of the earth and we're better off without her.\"\n\nI felt pretty accomplished with my trolling, not even considering the possibilty his grandmother could have actually died. Later that night, I returned to facebook only to see my comments had been deleted, and AssHat's comment about the awful things I had said. Turns out his Grandmother had actually died that day, and I was the worst best friend in the world. I of course apologized profusely, and attempted to explain myself, but he was still ticked at me for a couple of days.\n\nTL;DR:","completion":" Tried to troll my best friend, but accidentally killed his grandmother instead."}

It's not that I don't like to talk, I just don't usually talk unless I have something to say. That aside, women never talk to me first nor can they keep a conversation going. Even in group discussions in class, usually only the guys will discuss the topic with me. \n\nHere's the bizarre thing, I have a TON of gay friends that hit on me all the time. Why are the men so forward and confident, but women are all shy or uncomfortable \/ anxious around me? Tbh, I have the same amount of close gay friends as I have close straight guy friends. And obviously that ratio is pretty lopsided. And literally only women that I'm not very attracted to will try to be friends with me and they're always way cooler than most above average looking women(from my perspective). It's like there's some kind of tension there when I'm around attractive women. I don't know if it's what I say, or if I put off bad vibes, but it's usually only around attractive women. It's like even if I'm actually trying to hold a conversation, they don't contribute.\n\nMy luck has been bad enough to where I had sexual relations one time with my only best female friend and she has avoided hanging out with me ever since. I'm not sure what the problem was because we were pretty close. She didn't even give anything a chance, but I suspect this had to do with her relatively recent breakup.\n\nEvery women I've been with or been \"talking\" has said I'm too attractive for them. Idk if that's even related, but it's like they think they aren't good enough for me when I try to become more than friends. Sometimes I think how much easier it'd be if I was gay lol. Gay guys always find me one way or another, it happens all the time ha.\n\nAlso, my field of study has an inherent lack of women.

We didn't really mention it at first because we just didn't think about it - we all knew I'm a 'jailbait' and I knew he had to be at least 18 or older, apparently our age difference is 6 years. I'm stressing over it. \n\nFor Valentines day he's going to take me out. I'm really excited for it and if we have the same click again, I think we will become a couple. Just...

(Guess where I'm from) I got my drivers permit about 2 months ago, bought a car two weeks later with my hard earned money from the summer. The car was shitty to others but a full blown race car to me. Looked like crap but ran like a champ.

Coming up to my turn where for a good mile (in Dominic torretto voice) I'm free. On the turn there was a huge size puddle of water. I tried to avoid it completly but knew and figured that the front right tire will hit the water. Remember that word \"hydroplane\", yeah I fucked up. The left front tire went over then sunk, causing me the turn into the side of the road. Closer to the edge, the water is deeper. My engine choked, I'm really fucked.

What started off smoldering has really faded out the past few months. She was originally going to go to California for Grad School and decided to stay where we live to be with me essentially. I didn't ask her to do this, I advocated for her to leave. Ultimately I supported her decision because that's what you're supposed to do. Fast forward a couple of months later we are living together and everything is great, but we've only been together a few months. Over the course of the past few months I've become increasingly annoyed by her for no apparent reason. She's extremely needy and clingy and wants words of affirmation\/kisses\/cuddles constantly, but I don't feel the want to kiss her very often. I have begun to see her as more of a great friend whom I love, but I'm  not sure if I am in love with her. Are there any tips for becoming less annoyed from anyone in a similar situation? She honestly does nothing wrong and I'm extremely appreciative of everything that she does for me. I'm just not entirely happy. Any advice?\n\nTL;DR:","completion":" I'm not sure if I'm in love with my girlfriend anymore, but I'm living with her and don't know what to do."}

Presently, she does show some signs of potential gall bladder issues, but the symptoms in question predate this by years. She has been dealing with abdominal pain and constipation since the surgery.

Things got a bit strange there, as we held hands together and she grabbed me and hugged me on a couple of rides. After the theme park she goes, \"omg thanks for the best theme park trip ever <3 :).\" The next day she asked me to go to some youth thing her church is having. I said sure and she went on and on about how \"this meant a whole lot to her\" and how \"we're gonna have a great time :).\" I thought it was gonna be fun too, but at the actual thing she left me alone to my own devices, with total strangers (I wasn't sure about going for THIS EXACT REASON.) The next day was worse... She brought another guy with her and not only did she ignore me and ditch me again, she started getting all touchy-feely with this guy. Gee, I can see how much my presence means to her... I know we aren't actually dating yet or anything but man, that sucked big time to see her like that. I am contemplating not going anymore (its a week-long event) but the discussions and \"sermons\" are actually enlightening and to not go would basically ignore the teachings of said sermons - but I don't know if I really would enjoy seeing her like this and what effect it will have on my feelings in the long run (so far I feel hurt and neglected...)\n\nTL;DR:","completion":" Girl invites guy to church youth event, guy gets ignored and ditched by girl, guy is contemplating not going to the event anymore."}

Need positive encouragement from redditors regarding our transition to long-distance!\n\nText: My boyfriend and I have a great relationship. We don't live together but we live in the same city and see each other often.\n\nHe's just got his dream job in the US and once the visa is sorted will be moving there. He says he will stay for 2 years or so and then come back to be with me. He also says he's dedicated to me and that he won't let the distance ruin our relationship.\n\nWhile I believe truly that he means these things, I've been roughed up around the edges before about loves lost and have a failed long-distance relationship in my past.  I am having a huge amount of trouble accepting that our relationship can last.  He says my negativity is getting him down about it, and that if anything will ruin it, it will be my wet blanket.\n\nRedditors, can it work? Please share some positive helpful stories about long-distance that's really turned out for the best. I hear so much that goes wrong, and have had bad experiences. I need to channel a better outlook about this!\n\nTL;DR:","completion":" Girlfriend is skeptical about long-distance relationship working, needs some positive encouragement."}

Neither of us were happy in the relationship, but I told her I didn't want to be friendly going forward and basically never wanted to see or hear from her again. This is complicated by the fact that we live in the same neighborhood, went to college together and share some common acquaintances.\n\nEven though breaking up was very hard on me, I also stupidly followed through on a macho impulse to act as though it didn't particularly bother me at the time and, when she asked me how I was so calm, told her that it just felt better now that we had made a decision.\n\nSo, I think this adds up to me having been a jackass. And I really regret it because I have no end of respect for this woman. I've thought on and off about reaching out to apologize because it seems like the right thing to do, but I don't want to weird her out now 6 months out from breaking up.\n\n I have no desire to get back together with her, nor do I think she'd be interested in dating me again. However, I'd love for us to be on decent terms and feel like I probably messed that up. \n\nWhat do you all think? Better late than never or better never than late for this kind of thing?\n\nTL;DR:","completion":" Ex-gf and I broke up 6 months ago, I was an immature jackass about it and now I regret it.

We've said the \"i love you\"s and have awesome times together.\n\nMy main problem is that she is very independent and it leaves me feeling uncared for. For example, today we had lunch plans. I texted her a reminder and she said she already ate because she was hungry but that i could meet her at the library to hang out a bit. I feel fed up because many times she has set up a date only to cancel it or change it without seeming to think of me. \n\nI believe she isnt doing it purposefully and is just self focused. Still, i feel like im constantly stressed about our relationship and cant get a good read on what she is feeling. I want to get through to her but when i try to talk about our relarionship i just feel like im spoiling the mood. My question is: should i just accept this as part of her? Or is it worth fighting about? I consistently feel neglected but i know she loves me. Maybe im just too emotionally dependent.\n\nTL;DR:","completion":" Boyfriend is stressed about girlfriend's independence and lack of consideration for him.

I was zoned out for a bit and when I zoned back in the first thing I heard was the phrase,\" Why did she tell her father she was a prostitue,' and the inner twelve year old in me blurted out,\" Family Discount?\" \n\nNow keep in mind that I said this very quietly and carefully so only my peers heard it. But them my dumb ass of a friend decided it was to funny to not repeat so he yelled for the whole class to hear,\" Family discount.\" Then of course the teacher heard. So when my friend was confronted by the teacher he told her that I was the one who originally said it like the dumb ass he is. Needless to say both of us have detention for a week and I am grounded from my computer for a month.\n\nTL;DR:","completion":" I got detention for a week and am grounded from my computer for a month because my friend repeated something I said quietly in class."}

I've only recently begun to develop feelings for her, but it's been quite obvious to me for some time that she has had and now shares those feelings. I've really been trying to hide my feelings though because she; however, is in what her family, friends, and I call a terrible relationship. \n\nShe no longer has any guy friends left because they were all scared off by this guy and she's trying her hardest to keep the fact that she's been talking to and hanging out with me on the regular a secret because she's afraid that he'll harass me or try and hurt me. \n\nHer sister and I are also starting to get concerned that the relationship  might become physically abusive. I would like to specify that at this point it is only to the, best of my and her families knowledge, a verbally argumentative relationship, but she's told me it's been getting worse recently. And they have been dating for 6 months.\n\nI've never really been one to ask for advice, but I don't know if I should continue being passive and deal with the problems as they come or if I should just put myself out there? I'm just afraid if I do that I'll risk pushing her away and losing someone I consider to be my best friend. \n\nThat's my conflict, I just want to know what you think and if I should do anything at all, I know this is a rather small bit of information to go on so any advice at all would be helpful.\n\nThanks\n\nTL;DR:","completion":" Should the protagonist tell their best friend that they have feelings for her, despite her being in a verbally abusive relationship?"}

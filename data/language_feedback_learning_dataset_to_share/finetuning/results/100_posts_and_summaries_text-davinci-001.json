    "0": "This happened in California while I was driving on a local street to home. I was driving in the left lane on a main street that no where close to an intersection. The other car was in the middle lane and I guess the guy didn't check his blind spot because next thing I know he hits me. The damage on my car is on the passanger's side (behind the front wheel but in front of the side mirror) & the damage on his car is on his left bumper. \n\nThere was no police report and the guy is apparently claiming that I was trying to make a left turn on an intersection when he hit me..?  Apparently he has an attorney & I'm not sure if I should get a lawyer also. His son called me today & asked me to re-email him the insurance information because the information I gave him was apparently wrong. However, I talked to my insurance and they had already talked to the guy's insurance company so I'm not sure if he's lying or not. He also wants me to send me pictures of my car's damages because his father didn't take pictures of the damages. I know I shouldn't agree to that but is it safe to even send him the insurance information when it seems that our insurances are already talking?",
    "1": "Reddit I'm lost, she told me she got drunk and had sex with two other women. I told her i wasn't OK with that since it's cheating. She then snidely added, \"if you slept with two other guys I wouldn't care\" and I tried to explain that that wasn't the point, the point was she made a commitment to me and she broke that commitment by cheating in me. She still says it's not cheating because she was with other girls. Am I right in saying it's cheating or am I just going crazy? Also what should I tell her to knock some sense into her head?",
    "2": "I'm moving to the bible belt for the first time in my life in a few months due to my husband's job relocation (Nashville in fact), leaving my current full-time job to do so. \n\nI've been sending out applications for about a month to see if I can secure a job before moving. So far I have run across many positions and companies that call themselves \"faith-based\" or promote products such as Christian books or movies, probably 50% or the open positions I qualify for. I'm wondering if working for such a company would pigeon-hole me in the future. The rest of my background experience is quite varied at the moment, but it is mostly internships and one entry-level job since I graduated college recently. I likely won't be at this job for more than 3 years (my husband's job will move us once more) so I want to make sure I remain marketable. \n\nFor the record I'm an atheist and I work in the public relations/communications field.",
    "3": "I've been on vacation for a few days and it gave me some time to clear my mind  and give me some time to think about what I could do for me both in terms of self-growth and in terms of relationships.  \n\nI feel like I should lay low for a while and focus on me. I am overweight and want to lose a few pounds (hopefully starting before school starts up again in January) and do some things to make me more appealing because even though people think I'm attractive, I'm not considered attractive by a lot of the women at my school mainly because I don't have a six pack.  I also wanna be able to save up a bit of cash.  I have a little money but not a ton.  I'm a student with some bills and a job and wanna try to save a bit here and there when I can.\n\nOn the other hand, I wanna be able to make someone happy because I like making people smile and  I want to be able to make someone smile and show that I care about them because I like making people smile.",
    "4": "I apologize for the wall of text, but I want to be thorough with this.\n\nMy mom is 56, retired last summer, and kind of lapsing in the intellectual department. She's got nothing to do that occupies her time aside from watching TV. She's been doing more reading lately, even had me pick her up a booklight so should could read while my dad is asleep, but she's reading stuff that's clearly not intellectually challenging. She bought ~10 Debbie Macomber books at a garage sale and has been consuming then nonstop. She expressed some interest to me in reading something that's less fluffy, but I'm kind of at a loss on what to get her. \n\nI work in a bookstore, so you'd think that I'd be good at making these kinds of suggestions, and I've been trying with her. I tend to pick standard book club fodder, *The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society* was a book that she claimed to like, but there are other things I've picked up for her that she hasn't seemed interested in. \n\nShe also doesn't want anything \"dark.\" She's constantly complaining about the media that my father and I consume being too dark, too creepy, too violent, too sad, so on and so on. She doesn't seem to want anything that is too deep on the emotional scale, so I don't know what to do. I tend to feel like a book is really great when it rips my heart into a million pieces and puts it back together again in a different shape. I don't think my mom wants that. \n\nI'd like to get her a series, I've been thinking about *The No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency* by Alexander McCall Smith, but I'm not sure. I haven't read them, so what with them being mysteries rather than romance, I'm afraid she'll think they're \"too dark\" all over again. She's voiced interest in some \"good nonfiction\" but I'm not sure where to go with that either, since reality is often darker than fiction.\n\nThanks in advance.",
    "5": "Basically I want your opinion on dealing with a significant other's past. \n\nI hate my boyfriend's past. I hate his past relationships, friends with benefits, and friendships with other females that he had before me. I hate the girls he used to be infatuated with, the girls he was attracted to, etc.\n\nI'm the type who asked him for all these details, but ultimately hearing them made me upset and obsessed and filled with hatred.\n\nI snooped on his computer, his old profiles, and found things that I didn't like.\n\nMind you, this is the PAST. All these things that happened before me, shady or not, are a thing of the past: nonexistent. \n\nWhat do you think of your partner's past? How do you deal with it? Do you even care about it? \n\nI hate my behavior and would love to hear other people's perspectives on this issue.",
    "6": "Two years ago, my friend Trish went to a foreign country to study abroad. There, she met a guy, Frank, and they hit it off. \nNow, she's back in the foreign country for a year-long research program and is seeing the guy again. \n\nI think he's bad news.\n\nLast week my boyfriend sent Trish messages on facebook asking how she's enjoying the foreign country. He also asked her for help editing a short paper, since she's good at it (and he's not). She happily helped him, and everything was fine. \n\nExcept, that it wasn't. Two days later, Trish has deleted her facebook account and created a new one. She won't add any males as friends. \n\nMy boyfriend asked another mutual friend what was up, and the answer came back that Trish's boyfriend saw the facebook messages and became angry--so she deleted the account and made a new one with only girls as friends. \n\nMy boyfriend sent Frank a message explaining that they're only friends--and have been for a long time. He basically said \"chill out. Learn to trust her, but since you don't, you obviously have her fb messages and can read through them to see that I'm telling the truth.\" \nFrank replied saying that he was Trish's boyfriend, and that she shouldn't talk to any guy except him. \n\nHow can I explain this to her? The only way I can contact her is through the new facebook account--which I'm sure Frank monitors. I know Trish lives with Frank and his family in the foreign country--and I don't know that she has enough to move out. Beyond that, she seems happy with him. \n\nI just feel that it's extremely creepy and weird that Frank won't let her talk to her male friends back home.",
    "7": "The story goes that back in the early 1990s she decided to cook a whole salmon for a dinner party. She went and got the wild beast, already cleaned, from an excellent fish mongress near her house in NE Ohio. The fish mongress asked if my grandmother was going to prepare it in the DISHWASHER.\nMy Grandmother, looking very confused said \"I've never heard of that!\" The woman went on to describe the process:\n\n-Season the fish with a little salt and pepper inside and out.\n-Wrap it tightly in two layers of heavy duty foil.\n-Place the fish in the top rack of your dishwasher and run it with no other dishes or soap present.\n-Serve immediately.\n\nNeedless to say, it was the best salmon she and her guests ever had, and I wanted to share it with all of you.",
    "8": "My girlfriend, who I've been with for around a year and a half, has a history of self-harm (and so do I, but further in the past than hers). She stopped cutting herself about the time we started dating, saying that I was the main reason she felt happier. As far as I was aware, she never had any thoughts of relapsing, until yesterday when she revealed she has been burning herself with oil for a few weeks. This shocked and upset me; I can't help but feel like I'm 'not good enough' anymore...\n\nShe refuses to see a doctor or counsellor, or to seek any help other than the solace of physical pain. She won't tell me what has caused her to start harming again, and doesn't seem to understand how much it hurts me that she needs to hurt herself.\n\nWhat should I do? Am I selfish for worrying about our relationship almost as much as her physical and mental health?",
    "9": "So me and my girlfriend (both 22) have been together for around 3 months, we have gotten along so well that we never fight. The reason that me and her started talking is her cousin that USED to be her bestfriend since they were babies, and I say used to because from out of nowhere she started to make my gf's life a living hell, she became bestfriends with my ex-gf and started talking bad about her for no reason. My gf has anxiety but handled it pretty well, but then her ex-bf called her and told her that he and her cousin had sex twice and that he had to come clean to her. After that, her anxiety went through the roof, and even her attitude towards me has changed. I guess my question is, what should I do?",
    "10": "Alright. So the abridged version is basically we got into it because I looked at a celebrity gossip website randomly and she thought that was weird. Told her I looked at it because I'm fascinated by celebs (who hasn't thought it be cool to b a celebrity?) and she said she can't be with someone who want to be a celebrity so bad (I don't). So she asked to look through my phone history to see and I mentioned I delete my history. (I do. No real reason just always have. Not hiding anything) she says I'm sketchy. I say I can't be with someone who doesn't trust me. She throws my phone and starts walking away. I get in front if her and lightly push her to stop her from walking. Some random guy outside screams \"hey don't touch a girl like that\" She then proceeds to squeez my arm with her until it bleeds. She then slapped my head several times. After this she said she wanted to go home and I offered to give her a ride.  On the way home she proceeded to call me the scum of the earth, said she can't believe the way that I treat her. And I'm abusive.  Told me I don't deserve anyone because I put my hands on her.  What should I do I've never been in love before and this is my first real relationship.  I feel like my whole world is falling apart.  Any advice will be helpful",
    "11": "So over the past two years I've been lucky enough to save about 20k.  I've got it all in my checking account right now. I'd like to move most of that money into a savings account to be sort of an emergency fund and move about 4-5k into a checking account for my bills and everyday expenses.  Then, once I have the two accounts I can tailor my direct deposit paycheck to put the amount I'd like to save each month into my savings account and the rest will go into my checking.  Does this sound like a good idea?\n\nI'd like this new checking account to be somewhere that doesn't charge me any fees.  Right now I get docked 2 bucks at most ATM's and get a 5 dollar monthly fee...\n\n**Some other questions and facts about my self:**\n\nI've got 825 shares in MTW stock that I'd like to sell and put that money else where, but that's a whole other question and thread.  This is worth about 13k right now.  I'm also going to need to buy a new car here pretty soon.\n\nI'm young and have been lucky enough to save quite a bit of money.  I don't know a lot about personal fiance so far though.  Would it be a good idea to go to some sort of financial adviser to help me better plan out how to save my money?",
    "12": "For the past couple of years my father [M/52] has been married to my stepmother [F/44] and I [M/18] think she is overstepping boundaries and is taking advantage of my father in many situations.\n\nNow, first of all, she isn't some horrible step mother, but she isn't great either. She doesn't have any kids of her own so she tries to punish me as if I was her kid, which my father allows. This would honestly not be a big deal, if she seemed sane...\n\nShe nitpicks at everything I do one week, and then loves me the next. The littlest thing can trigger her, such as what happened tonight.\n\nI ran out of batteries in my remote, so I replaced them with the batteries in my dad's remote, which were in his bedroom. I do this a lot, and then hide the used batteries somewhere obvious so he puts them in and then the remote still doesn't work.\n\nNothing happened for a while, so I assumed they just replaced the batteries, so I fell asleep. I was awakened to screaming and yelling and slamming of the opening of my door. My stepmother was yelling about how 'going into their room was an invasion of privacy'... I would understand that if the door was locked... Or closed... Or not wide open... Or if I was never allowed to go in there before... But, no. It had never been an issue before. She now told me that she doesn't trust me, and doesn't think she will be able to sleep in the same house as me...\n\nShe walked out, still yelling and shouting, and I told my father that I think it is essentially bullshit what she is doing, but all he does is nod and agree with her and say 'I need to stay on the same page as her. That's what a marriage is.'",
    "13": "When the internet began to pick up speed in the days of the 56k modem, I remember fearful talks about how this new technological tool would revolutionize the contemporary era. \n\nOutside of highly accessible porn, mass mp3 theft, and the rise of troll culture I don't really feel that the internet has lived up to its expectations. \n\nI look at the recent financial crisis, the BP oil spill, and the state of the US energy infrastructure at large and I can't help but wonder if the internet will one day provide us will an effective tool to apply collective social pressure to stop these travesties. It feels like a far off utopian ideal. \n\nYet I see places like reddit full of people that at least seem like they care. \n\nIn theory the internet is the ultimate tool for social connection and information exchange. This makes me believe that technological solutions are out there which we simply haven't bothered to enact. \n\nThis then leads me to the thought that maybe if we collectively put our heads together we could either 1) devise a way to apply political pressure from the web or 2) organize to effectively solve glaring social and political problems ourselves (particularly since it is clear that banking and oil interests have a death grip on the current political structure).\n\nThe ultimate obstacle is then motivation to act (hence the title question). \n\nHowever I recognize the possibility that people may not want to put in the effort to change the status quo. There is also a distinct possibility that people enjoy the status quo enough to discourage the risk of change. \n\nHence I ask, \"Would you be willing to start an internet spawned social/political revolution?\"\n\nWhen I ask this I do not want the opinion of \"people\" or \"society at large\". I am wondering how you personally feel about taking on such an endeavor.",
    "14": "We will call her Rita. Rita and I have been friends for almost 5 years. During the beginning of our friendship she had told me that she was recovering from depression but it had gotten a lot better. Throughout our friendship there are a few things I have noticed about her. \n\n1.\tShe is extremely insecure, recently she lost a lot of weight and I tried to tell her she looked great, however she couldn't accept the compliment and be proud of what she has accomplished so far. That is just an example but it runs a lot deeper than that.\n\n2.\t I'm not sure if her and her boyfriend want to be together anymore or if they are staying together because they have been together for so long/ fear of being alone (been together since grade nine)\nIn regards to the boyfriend, he has broken up with her 3 or 4 times and she always begs for him to take her back and he always does.\n\nHe just recently purchased a house with his father without consulting her on location or her desires for their home. The house is outside of the city and away from all of the things she values and she has told me that she is very upset about the purchase. (I just found out this information last night)\n\n3.\tI found she has become stagnant in her growth, she never steps outside her comfort zone and doesn't believe in herself.\n\nI haven't talked to her in almost 8 months because she was becoming very frustrating with all of these factors. Always complaining and never feeling good about herself. Well last night she called me to see if I wanted to get some coffee with her. I agreed but I'm not sure If it's my place to bring up that I think she needs professional help, or if recommending it would be a good idea.",
    "15": "I've been seeing this girl for a little over a month now, things have been going great! We have been texting frequently and seeing each other multiple times a week. \n\nWe are both extremely busy and dedicated to our school work, which I like, but she also competitively figure skates. So here's the problem, this week on top of tests/assignments/practice etc she also has a big competition that she has said she hasn't had a lot of time to prepare for. I have no figure skating experience, so I can't really feel her pain and I feel like I can't really give her legitimate support. Even worse, her schedule is completely blocked up this week so she can only text. It would be ok if I could see her to tell her it'll be ok, but I really don't know what I can really say texting trying to make her feel comfortable.\n\nAlso, since we started talking, messaging has been pretty consistent. But in the days leading up to the competition, she's been kind of short and dispersed with her communication. I've been giving her space and not texting because I know she's busy, and she's been starting conversations at night. Even though I know she's unbelievably busy, I can't help but feel she is being a little distant. \n\n---\n\nSo tonight is her big night. What the hell can I text her if she tells me she totally bombed her routine? \n\nAlso, do you think the distance could be because she's possibly losing interest? Or am I just paranoid haha. We have a date Monday after she's done everything, I plan on casually asking her about why she was being a little distant when we go out.",
    "16": "I have a two and a half year old bichonpoo that I took the groomers the other day. We had moved from another city so this would be her second appt. at this groomer. It had been a year since her last appointment because my family and I decided to groom her ourselves. She was happy and excited when we got there and pee'd a little when the groomer examined her. When we came back to pick her up, the groomer said that was aggressive all throughout and tried to bite her several times. They eventually put a dog muzzle on her. My mom and I were so surprised by this because she has NEVER showed any aggression towards a human or towards any of her previous groomers. In fact, she loves being cuddled by other people and goes to people whenever we're at a dog park. \n\nWhat do you guys think went wrong and what could I do for the next appointment?\nAt first I thought it was because of her matted fur. The groomer shot this theory down and said that my dog was aggressive even after getting the matted hair out.  She has also been a lot more matted before (the very first time when she was a puppy) and had never had aggression issues. Or could it be that she was gone for the groomers for too long and didn't feel comfortable in a relatively new environment with a different groomer? Or could it also be the groomer herself, and that my dog just didn't like her? The previous groomer didn't have any issues. \n\nWhat should I do the next time we go to the groomers? It will be a new groomer again and I hope she doesn't lash out. Will she be able to feel comfortable again? I'm scared that if she becomes too aggressive, no one will take her... :(",
    "17": "Without getting too into it, I was kind of a dick to my ex while we were dating. It got real bad towards the end of the relationship to the point where she cut all contact with me and had her friends tell me things for her. \n\nThis was about 10 years ago give or take, and we've both moved on into our own serious relationships.\n\nI feel like I owe her a huge apology for being such an ass. The problem is that I don't want my current S.O. to know as I worry she'll freak out about it. \n\nI'm also not sure if there's even a point anymore, like my ex has most likely moved on and never thinks about me. \n\nI've been thinking about her more lately and even have had dreams of me talking and apologizing to her.",
    "18": "So I was good friends with this girl for about half a year or so and I fell in love with her. Long story short about a week ago I decided to tell her how I felt about her to which she said she does feel like there is something there, but doesn't want to jeopardize our friendship and we should just remain friends.\n\nAt the time I thought that was okay and that I would be fine with that, but as the weeks gone on I've realized that I don't think I can see her as just a friend in my eyes anymore. I'm still crazy in love with her, I know I gotta just let the feelings go but I can't, I don't know how to. Whenever I look at her I see a girl that i'm madly in love with, not just a friend.\n\nI really need some advice or something I don't know what to do, I don't want to lose her as a friend, but I'm also still not over her, I love her too much.",

For my major I'll be going into Computer Engineering due to the fact that I've spent all of my life so far on the computer, so why not make it my job?\n\nI've listened to numerous college students who were incredibly passionate during their presentation and it made me wonder if me going into Computer Engineering is a good idea after all and if I'd enjoy it. It's pretty much all I've got going for me so, I'm guessing I should stick with it?",
    "20": "Hello, Reddit.  I usually don't post much but this is a big problem for me and I would like to get more points of view, information regarding the situation, and any possible courses of action I could take to help.\n\nFirst off, I would like to say I love reading both this subreddit and r/longdistance. I love seeing how supportive you guys are and it restores my faith in people quite often.  I like reading both subreddits when I'm upset.\n\nMy girlfriend, lets call her Samantha, has a lot of issues with her home life.  Her mom is bipolar and quite frankly nuts, she has these episodes where she physicially abuses Samantha and her younger siblings that live with her.  She has gone as far as throwing razor blades and glass objects at her.  Samantha does everything she can to make her mom calm down, but sometimes this is just met with even more violence.  Her mother will hit the younger kids as well and Samantha does her best to protect them and stand up for them.  \n\nEven when she isn't going through an episode like this, Samantha's mother doesn't treat her well in any respect.  She gives her the responsibilities of an adult, yet treats her like a child.  Samantha has 2 facebook accounts, the initial reason being that her mother wouldn't let her talk to her dad and his side of the family, but now she uses it a lot to talk to my mom and I.  Her mother knows the account information for her original one and goes on there and reads her conversations and such.  She does everything she can to control every aspect of Samantha's life.  It seems like she's even trying to break us up, but I doubt that's going to work out for her.\n\nMy mom told her that we would all come up with something together to do to help her, but I honestly don't know what kind of a solution could be presented.  I would love to hear reddit's opinion and if you guys think there's anything we can do to help her.  We are all here to support and and do whatever we can.",

That said, it got your attention, so meh.\n\nSo I have had a rough go of things lately. Got dumped by my first girlfriend and not long after serious health issues arose. In between seizure like episodes and a whole bunch of other symptoms I havent had much time for dating. \n\nAt the same time it is something I have always wanted, and was something that meant so much to me when I started dating this ex (S) at the late age of 22. So while I have sort of been out of commission I have been feeling... lonely... I guess is the word for it. I kept messaging my ex, nothing aggressive or mean just a \"hey\" and some needy follow up once every 2 months until she threatened to call friends and family to get me to stop. Since then I have felt... I dunno... crazy. That was a little while.\n\nThe past couple months health has improved. I have been making more friends and have started getting back into interests outside of work and doctors visits. I messaged this one girl I used to hang out with and we met up to go to perform at a comedy show. Other friends were there, so it wasn't like a date, but I really liked spending time with her. We made plans to do it again.\n\nI guess my worry is... all my other friends are completely coupled with a SO. Add to the fact that I want to do more comedy and would like someone to do it with. I am very eager to date someone but am not sure with my condition and just the way I have been that it is a good idea or even fair for her. Some of my symptoms might make things a little tricky. Id be fine with a friend to do shows with... but I dont know where my health could go and this could be my last chance for all I know.

I've started to like her a lot and i'm not sure if she likes me back, i get some mixed signals.\n\nSo, should I tell her how I feel? I wanna get to know her better and connect as more than friends. My fear is its gonna get akward when we are all togheter and I wouldn't want to loose her friendship and the general relationship I have with the group.\n\nWhat about asking her out and seeing her reaction?

My friends, on the other hand, are legitimately gorgeous, long hair, even skin tone, nice bodies etc. My parents and brother are also quite good looking themselves (for context, my father is Indian, my mother is Irish/Spanish). Which is great, I'm happy for them and that's not what bothers me.\n\nWhat bothers is me is that they take every chance that they get to bring me down when it comes to my appearance. On Valentine's day, my friend, Anna, was bitching about how no one in our group received a rose and the gist of what she said was basically, \"I mean, Kylie's face is gorgeous, Olivia has a hot body, I can be a solid 7 if I tried. But I guess with you, I can understand.\" \n\nAnna also bitched about the fact that I have been asked out by guys a few times, while she has not, \"I mean, you're not even attractive, lets be real.\"\n\nThat hurts like hell, but they're teens, I can understand. But my parents are like that as well.\n\nI'm quite self conscious about my weight and proportions and my parents are very aware of that. I am quite underweight at <50kg and 168 cm. But my parents take every opportunity they can to prod at my stomach, make comments like, \"Oh, you're gaining weight.\" etc. These comments have actually driven me to a mild eating disorder which I hate with all my heart.\n\nThey also love to point out my pimples and \"butch\" haircut (I do have a pixie cut) and overall teenage weirdness.\n\nI'm really bitter about it and it would be great if you guys could give me some tips on how to confront them.

She's smart with money, she's financially secure, she loves kids (she wants to be a housewife). My family likes her, I've never met her family.\n\nBut come this fall she's going to be working her first job in Ohio and I'm going to attend graduate school in Minnesota to get my PhD in Physics (for the next ~5.7 years).

As time passed, however, we found that we were perfect together. We share the same interests, personality, and we still have enough difference to make it interesting. Most of you might be asking yourselves \"where's the problem?\". \n\nWell, most people get married when they're older. They go through life, getting experience, learning stuff, meeting new people, and having some good stories to tell when they're at the bar with their friends. Instead of going out and meeting people, me and my girlfriend are happy to stay at home watching movies and eating pizza. If I let myself be happy (short-term) I could be trapped in a long-term relationship (love) that would deny me these experiences. I want to be single again.\n\nThen I look at all the older people, (like some on this Reddit) that are looking for EXACTLY what I have.

    "32": "She and my father divorced 3 years ago under (relatively) amicable terms.  He was married again within 1-2 years.  They speak very rarely.\n\nThe issue is this: she is very depressed and can't move on with her life.  She's relatively functional in her professional life, but she's made it clear she misses having someone to talk to the way that she talked to my dad (both are very smart people, and she has a hard time getting that with her friendships and colleagues).  She has a tendency to drink too much and I catch her with 'bummed' cigarettes.  She's made a few attempts at online dating, but has always found her dates to be dull or socially inept or uninteresting.  Personally, I think the problem stems from the fact that she has been with my father since she was 19 and therefore never had to develop dating skills...she's probably shy and would rather avoid it.  Not to mention that exuding unhappiness makes you a pretty dull date!\n\nI'm worried because I'm moving to a different state soon and I want her to be on an upswing before I leave.  She's halfheartedly tried therapy and stays on antidepressants for a while but it never seems to go anywhere.  I think the bottom line is that she's unhappy, has low self worth, and is exceedingly picky about men.  What can I do to move her in the right direction?  I know that this has to come from within, but it's driving me insane watching her wallow in sadness.  I want to be sensitive but it seems so obvious she just needs to toughen up, put herself out there, and realize that she deserves happiness!",
    "33": "So my ex gf and I dated for about 6 months. We hit things off really well and found we have incredibly similar tastes, hobbies, interests, etc, but failed to be compatible personality-wise. It was my first relationship so I had a good deal to learn and I wasn't exactly the fastest learner.\n\nAnyways, we jumped into the relationship very quickly, after maybe a month of talking, and had sex very soon. The beginning was nothing like I had anticipated and we had a ton of road bumps along the way but were always able to patch things up. Things eventually got much better after a big fight and we were together all the time and loved each other's company. Towards the end of the relationship I felt her pulling away. I consider myself the jealous type and I think that's for a couple of reasons: I have always been put down for my looks and developed a generally lower self-esteem, and also because she was insanely hot. From the moment she caught my eye till today, she has always been the most beautiful girl I have seen, and I always made sure she knew that. So my jealousy of whenever she'd talk to other guys was definitely something that was always present.\n\nBasically now it's all over and we're not even near each other distance-wise. I find myself missing her more every day and we still talk like friends but I just don't think I'll ever get over her... What do I do?",
    "34": "So, last July I moved in with my boyfriend... And I had to leave my beautiful 5 year old chocolate lab behind in my hometown with some family. It's killing me to be away from her. We currently live in the basement of someone else's house, and they aren't fussy about having another dog around. We planned on moving out of the house this summer and getting our own apartment.. The thing is, animal friendly apartments are hard to come by around here, and me and my boyfriend both work 7 on 7 off and wouldn't get to see her for a week at a time. Even before I left she was always inside moping, I felt so guilty.\n\nI know she's happy where she is now, always going hunting and playing with other dogs, but due to past experiences (being forced to part with animals I loved, promising to take care of a rescue and being unable to do so) I feel obligated to take her with me.\n\nWhat would you do in my situation?",

He looks great and seems like an okay guy but I feel like if I was in his situation I wouldn't even look at someone as young as me. It makes me think that he's strange to want to even talk with someone who is in a completely different stage of their life and are naive about a lot of aspects of life that he's experienced. He's come on pretty strong and I can make this into something if I want to. So what do y'all think, does he have issues? Using me for sex? Or can someone who is older and has dated with that much of an age gap explain why he would date that much younger",
    "36": "I don't know how to ask this without it sounding really silly, but this is a genuine problem. I created a throwaway because of too much personal detail in my main account. \n\nMy boyfriend and I are both grad students and have been together for four months now. I absolutely love him. He's sweet, caring, tolerant, liberal, basically every single thing on my 'checklist', if I had one, is there. \n\nThe problem, though, is he talks VERY slowly. I mean his speed is really slow. If I ask him anything, he takes about 3 seconds before he starts to talk, then when he starts, the words go at a very slow pace,and he even pauses for 3-5 seconds in the middle of his sentence. I get really impatient and sometimes just feel like telling him to hurry up (of course I don't, but I really feel like doing so). \n\nI asked him today, very gently, why he spoke so slow, and he said he just gets thoughts very slowly in his brain. He then went on to say he's just generally slow at thinking. I felt really sad when he said this, I don't know why. He's a Math PhD student,and we are at a pretty good school, and his research has been going slow for a while now (but this is totally normal in grad school), so I think that response was kind of a self-deprecating one since he's already low on self-esteem. \n\nAnyway, my point is, his speed of talking is just a part of him, it can't be changed. I love him so much otherwise but I just want to know how to deal with this. Conversation is so important in a relationship! How do we manage? He's an introvert and talks very little in general; I suspect this has something to do with his pace of talking?",

I told him that we had kissed on the dance floor last year and he barely remembered it, which I don't have a problem with. \n\nBasically, my first kiss was not that significant emotionally (but it was pretty good), but the fact that I'm dating the guy I had my first kiss with is...interesting. It wasn't his first kiss. He's my first boyfriend; I'm not his first girlfriend. Also, he's the first (and only) person I've had sex with, while I'm not the first person he's had sex with.\n\nShould I tell him that he was my first kiss? Would he find it a funny coincidence, or be a little weirded out that he's been my \"first\" for all these things? I don't want him to think I'm super clingy or that I planned this all out or something. It's true that I was a little extra interested in him the second time we met because of our past encounter, but that definitely didn't become the basis of my attraction to him. \n\nI'm debating between not telling him at all, or waiting until we've known each other for longer.

She started to not reply to my messages even though i made it clear to her that I would want us to be just friends. A while later, i went to start another convo on facebook with her, and it had appeared that i couldn't reply to her anymore, nor could I view her profile. I had found out she had blocked me. I'm assuming her new bf told her to block me on all social medias because he probably saw our previous messages, why i assume this is because we had talked before and whenever I would bring up the girl he would make an angry facial expression and also because he had also blocked me. So after I found out I was complaining to a best friend about this and he messaged the girl about how she had me blocked and she said \"I didn't know\".

    "47": "So I don't think I've seen a question like this yet (or the Reddit search is just crap), so here goes.\n\nLast month, we had to hire a new bartender at our restaurant, and I was in charge of training her. In the first night of training, I found out she was engaged. A swing and a miss!\u00a0\n\nThe next day of training, her fianc\u00e9 came in to the bar area to get some food and to see how she was doing. He had mentioned that her friend was running late, and wanted to come check out her new place of work. After making some small talk with the fianc\u00e9, in walks in the friend. She's cute as hell. I let the new girl talk to her friend a bit, and she introduces me.\u00a0\n\nI wish I could meet more girls when I'm at work. I'm in \"my element\" (I've been there the longest, and am practically managing the bar), I'm confident, and I'm typically happy. I feel like I left a good impression, too. I initiated contact (I told her I didn't catch her name, because I was busy, and shook her hand and \"greeted\" her), I made her laugh, I suggested sushi to order (which she liked), I taught her how to use chop sticks (she said many have tried to, and she finally got the hang of it when I showed her. + a little more contact!), and helped her with a problem she was having at the moment (how to hook up a Nintendo through a VCR (text message)).\u00a0\n\nOverall, I think I did well.\n\nProblem is, how do I see her again? I've told the new girl that I thought she was very cute, which she responded with a slightly excited \"She's single!\" (which I guessed kind of strangely when she was talking about her new kitten to the new girl.)\u00a0\n\nSo, with my only channel of my coworker, how can I see her again to possibly ask her on a date without it being strange?",

I don't have full custody, just every other weekend.  \n\nThis morning I was offered a job in New Mexico (I live in Louisiana).  The pay would be double that of what I've made at any job in the past so I would absolutely have the means to fulfill my responsibilities.

As with any normal parent, my kids are the two most important people in my life and even not seeing them for two weeks is hard enough.

Just need some advice, thanks. :)\n\nThe problem is that he has always had a much lower sex drive than I do. We have sex maybe 3 or 5 times a month, and when we do it is usually satisfying for both of us. But he usually just says he is too tired or that he wants to get up early so he has to sleep instead of sex, or some other barely-believable excuse. I basically just have to wait for him to initiate sex. He claims to be very attracted to me and I am extremely attracted to him. \n\nI still feel a lot of pressure to initiate sex and seduce him, even though when I do it rarely works which usually ends up with me being all excited for no reason. There is a constant conflict in my mind about whether or not to attempt any seduction and risk the rejection.\n\nThis whole situation is slowly eroding my self-esteem and I feel like I am acting like a different person more and more. I have talked to him about it but he takes it very personally (understandably) and I basically have to accept him how he is or break up.\n\nIs this a bad reason to break up?

In a moment of clarity (before anything could happen) I looked at him and told him this was probably a huge mistake - we still have six months on our lease - and someone may end up getting hurt if we let anything happen between us.

    "69": "In September my boyfriend of 10 months (Bart) broke up with me. We had been fighting almost all summer and it was a long, heartbreaking process. For the last month he insisted he didn't need to say \"I love you\" and we almost never had sex. Awful. \n\nAbout a month later my ex (Steve) from less than an hour away just dumped his ex and we entered a sort of FWB situation. We had been there before because we have excellent sexual chemistry, but the romance wasn't there for YEARS. Now, after a month, the first ex (Bart) and I exchanged letters and we agreed to a friendship, he started going to the gym with me and it was a really good. We both achieved long-sought goals of physical fitness and he was a good motivator. The past two weeks he's been getting cozier. Four days ago he came over and we finally kissed again and we had a loooong talk. I explained that telling somebody you don't love them, and wont have sex with them, isn't a real relationship. He had many many emotional outbursts in the past, which I explained were totally unacceptable. \n\nThen he pulled what feels like a high school girl move and opened up about a dark secret (long story is he was taken advantage of by a Sugar Daddy who helped pay for college expenses and it had repercussions that manifested as intimacy issues). I told him I didn't really give a shit about it. I also told him that I'd be open to another attempt at a relationship but I wont call him my boyfriend or partner until \"It damn well feels like it\". Maybe that wasn't fair of me. \n\nSo here I am, between two boys. The FWB (Steve) needs to be made aware because we established an exclusive sexual relationship for health reasons. I dunno if I want to go back to an emotionally immature, possibly sexless relationship. Oh and all three of us aren't financially independent because student loans lol",

We've spoken about this opportunity and she knows how ambitious I am and was happy for me to go for it but we're both going to be upset and miss each other if I accept and leave.\n\nThankfully the opportunity is in Dublin and we're currently in London so it's a 1 hour flight away and relatively cheap to get there and back.\n\nWhile I don't like the idea of leaving her I'm not sure if I'd ever get this kind of opportunity again.

She did less apologizing, to the extent that I worry that she doesn't believe she did anything wrong in the relationship or that I had no reason to doubt her.  \n\nSince then, I initiate most of our meeting, texts and everything.  She no longer seeks me out as she did before.  When we talk about things that caused the split, she gets mad and I find myself apologizing for wanting to see her.\n\nShe doesn't have many friends, and during the time we were apart she became more active in a college club.

    "73": "Hi, long time owner of cats, parents got cats and I am really used to them, I own now a castrated male 4 year old persian. My daugther is almost one year old and she usually tries to catch him removing some of his hair and sometimes the cat answers and has made her some tiny scratches, nothing that would worry me up since the cat is always inside the house and I don't fear it would give her some kind of illness.\n\nThe problem came today, my daughter was softly caressing him (sometimes she does) and the cat started hissing at her, I came just quick and took the cat apart, that was this morning and not (afternoon here in Spain) the cat hasn\u00b4t stopped hissing at any of us, my wife and my daughter just got to have lunch with some friends and I'm staying with the cat.\n\nIf I stay still seated on one place the cat will calm down and relax where he can watches me, as soon as I walk he runs by me starts hissing at me, even scratched me on the ankle and won't stay too far away from me.\n\nNow I have him locked in a room with its food, water and sand and he keeps meowing. Called the vet and he told me to keep the cat locked and checked from time to time until monday when he'll make a full check on the cat to see what's wrong.\n\nI guess he is in pain, that's why he's violent and obviously he tried first with my daughter since she is the weakest, now that she is gone he has only me to attack.\n\nAny advice?",
    "74": "So I've been dating this guy for over a month, hasn't introduced me to his friends, and every time we hang out it leads to sex. He says that is just his way of showing his \"like\" for me. Here is where my mind becomes boggled. Whenever I try to do something sweet or caring for him he compares it to his ex. He tells me they don't talk anymore but I know for sure that is a lie. When someone sends him a text he hides it or the expression on his face changes to automatic \"Please don't let her find out.\" I feel like we are fuck buddies with a stupid boyfriend/girlfriend title.

I've been dealing with depression - been seeing a therapist and taking antidepressants. So i've been working on myself a lot. \n\n-------\nThis is my last year at Uni and I'm finally starting to make some progress with other women, but every day my heart still aches for my ex. \n\n------\nThe thing is, I'm ususally pretty good at knowing if how I feel is temporary or whatever, I feel like I'm good at gauging the severity of my emotions. I've been working very hard to get over and to stop loving my ex but I have this gut feeling and deep fear that I never will. I'm afraid that I'm going to live my life and regret not trying to get back with her - but I know i'm not ready to try that. \n\n-------\nfinally, I keep expecting to see her around campus. Every girl who even slightly resembles her I see her face and my heart flutters like \"oh shit there she is\". I'm constantly feeling nervous. I also wish for nothing more than for her to contact me. I made a decision that if I'm going to talk to her again it would have to be her that contacts me - I'd just feel too weak and immasculated if I did again.\n\n------\n\nWhat can I do here? I'm just so sad and anxious. Thanks.",

I know this is probably her youth talking, but knowing her, she takes the stuff she says way more seriously than the average girl. \n\nI'm afraid she'll take it very hard and her process of recovery will be much longer than it should be. Hell, I'm afraid she might never actually let this go. I don't know.\n\nI feel extremely guilty because she's begged me to come back since, and I told her a straight out no, because I didn't think the relationship would last long after this. It's only been a few days, and I'd say I've made significant progress recovering (it's been very tough though), but she hasn't turned up to school or spoken to many people. She only confided in a couple of friends and bawled her eyes out at them.\n\nMy friends told me that most breakups are one-sided anyway and it was inevitable that I'd be the asshole in the situation.

    "83": "So this basically just happend to me Im a 16 year old high school student and basically what happend to me was I was cleaning out my pigs pen after school and I hear a truck I look out and see the truck along with a couple of people from my class. Everything was perfectly fine but all of a sudden I hear a \"BANG BANG\" really fucking loud and I was in the pen inside the building and during the loud BANG I heard yelling, then my stomach just dropped I was sure it was gun shots or something. It was extremely loud and had a Pop-ing sound So I droped the shovel and what I was doing and jumped over the walls seprateing the pens then sprinted out the back door onto a trail. After I got out far enough I called my Father warning him not to go the the Agriculture area. After the trail ended at a no trespassing sign I ran through bushes and branches getting scraped up until I reached the clearing where I ran down to the schools office. The first thing they notice is im shaking, sweating, and stuttering like a motherfucker and asked what happend. I reported the incident and someone went up to check it out. Turns out what happend was one of the older boys that were up there was angry and he has some issues so he grabed a pig cane and smashed it against the building twice breaking it. It takes alot of force to break one of those or even dent a building which lead me to belive it was a gun shot. But I don't know I just feel like a bit of a coward and a idiot all at the same time and feel kinda bad about myself a little bit. The boys both aplogized to me but i still feel like a jack ass. Along with having to go to that class tommrow I know for a fact my teacher is going to question me and im gonna get a call from the therapist.

I turn to look at the cop, and both her and her partner are staring at me. I just ignore it as the lights turn green and they turn left as I go straight. A couple of seconds later, I see in my rear view mirror that they pull a 360 in the middle of the intersection and their lights turn on. I assume they got a distress call until they start tailing me. I know I did nothing wrong because I went when the light was green and I was only doing about 55 - 60KM in a 50KM zone (Yes, I am in Canada).\n\nI pull over into the nearest parking lot and turn off my car.

There have been times that I want to text ex-colleague and ask her to check up on her friend after hearing a nasty fight, but I refrain because it's none of my business. Anyway, it's important to me to stay on friendly terms with my ex-colleague because there is a very real chance we will become colleagues again in the next couple of years. I also work in a rather tight knit industry, so it would behoove me to just stay friendly either way.\n\nI know that the upstairs girl knows that we have a mutual friend and would report back if I did anything passive aggressive. I don't like confrontation and honestly, being passive aggressive would be my preferred way to handle this. My ex-colleague is the only reason I haven't taken a broom to the ceiling yet.\n\nSo, I come to you. Is there a diplomatic way to ask my upstairs neighbors to please shut the hell up?",

This distance will not go away for atleast the next 6+ years and I totally realize sustaining a LDR with no end goal is very difficult.\n\nShe said said she would like to break up and become friends as we get closer to going our seperate ways. Initially, I wanted to atleast give it a shot and see what comes of it - and if we were both truly unhappy I would be fine with breaking it off.

It bothers me when I realize I wont get to know the little things in her life or be a priority anymore. It bothers me that eventually she will get intimate with someone else thats not me. She was the first person I would tell when something happened to me, now I dont know who will listen to the little things with the genuine interest she had. Again, this is my first long term relationship so I'm wondering does it really get better. Will I wake up one morning and no longer wonder how she is doing?

    "91": "Thank you in advance for anyone taking the time to read/reply to this. Last August, I (29M) started working full time after a LONG period of unemployment. Before that I worked freelance as a graphic/web designer and photographer but it wasn't enough to make a decent living. I own professional equipment and have 5 weddings under my belt, but my biggest problem is self-promotion and advertising (I'm not the most confident person when it comes to selling myself). At this new job, I'm working 40+ hours a week making $15/hr. The job is related to my field (graphic design), but it's not a creative position. I'm basically pumping out orders for this company based off of templates. The first few months were okay since I was learning new techniques and a new program, but now I feel like a robot and this place is sucking the life/energy out of me. There is no sick time, no personal time, the building itself is not well-maintained, and there is nowhere to move up in the company. The only thing keeping me going is the idea that it's not permanent. My plan was to make it a year at this place, save some money, and figure out the rest when the time came. I live with my SO and am lucky to have very low expenses (<$500/mo) I've managed to save around 15k in the time I've been there. I miss the freedom that came with freelance work, but having a steady paycheck is certainly nice. It's very tough to find a job in my area, so on one hand I feel lucky to be in the situation I'm in, but on the other I feel like I can do much better.",
    "92": "I was recently dumped, about three days ago, after weeks of begging my ex not to do it. She had had a thing for me since third grade and we started dating two years ago in highschool. Things were pretty okay, but we did take one three week long break. In that break she started flirting with someone else, and it was awful. We did, however, get back together. That was about a month ago. \n\nNow for the past few weeks she has been dancing around the idea of breaking up with me and I have always plead with her not to. I told her I would never talk to her again, never see her again, that I would never give her another chance, and that I would start talking to someone else, because that's exactly what she did to me. After two weeks of telling her all this about once or twice a day she did it anyway. Today she told me about how she wanted me back, but I told her I was talking to a few other girls at this point. Her exact words were \"Fuck you, have a good life.\"\n\n I feel horrible about this whole thing, we haven't had the HEALTHIEST relationship, but it's still one I never wanted to end. We both had our faults; she would get mad at me for just having friends that were girls, but I'm a very social guy and like to make new friends. I would get mad at her for always delving WAY too deep into everything we ever talked about. (An example of this would be: My ex got upset with me for talking to this one girl, Girl B, purely as a friend, who lived about an hour south of me. I told her that was fine, I would just stop talking to Girl B, again purely as a friend. My ex then got mad at me for \"still wanting to be friends with  Girl B\", and threatened to break up with me so I could \"Finally go be friends with more people.\") I want to fix things but at the same time, I'm worrying that things will never get better.",
    "93": "Let's see my ex SO of 5 years and I have been trying to work things out, but there are some factors that pretty much scream RUN.

It turn out that I was right in the end about them \"talking\". Well we got back together not too long after I found out, because he was begging and promising that he did not know what he was doing and that he would drop it and I was in a tough place because I lost someone(death). Well years have passed, and we had broken up again. This time he told me that he had liked her, months later we started to try and rekindle things and then I saw him talking to her again, but he claimed he was fighting with her because she was talking to a kid he did not like. I asked him why he cared so much, and he said it was because she was his friend and he despises the kid. Which I know it total bullshit, but yet we were still trying to work on things. After months have passed, we still are trying until he started hanging out at her house, and she has been attending parties at his with her boyfriend and all because they all have mutual friends. He will talk to her, and continue to hang with her and friends. This is all no problem since we are technically not together. The issue is he does not understand why I would not be with him if he was friends with her, and he thinks it would be okay to be friends with this girl if we did get back together.

    "94": "We've lived together for a month now and we are usually very happy together but we've also survived a lot of shit already. Bad friendships, new dog, kicking a housemate out for her. After every tense situation, I am the one apologizing and I understand I haven't handled things exactly as she wanted, but it worries me how few mistakes she has admitted and how empathetic she is not. I read recently that people who love you are by your side even when you suck. I feel that is the only time when we are not close. Like the success of this relationship depends on my ability to make x number of mistakes or fewer. Shouldn't it be more about understanding each others' intentions and avoiding offending each other, while forgiving mistakes? I feel that she has never really forgiven me. Each time I apologize she accepts it as if I said \"it won't happen again\" instead of accepting it because it was an honest miscommunication or mistake. Similarly, she rarely apologizes because she is who she is. I'll admit that she makes very few mistakes but the ones she makes are very personal like not paying attention to me when I am sad or not acknowledging the legitimacy of my feelings. She is an affectionate person but only on her own time. There are very specific occasions that people need a hug or a shoulder and she does not look for ways to console me in those times, despite my requests that she be more attentive. I do not want to leave her but I will if need be. We are very compatible, save for this caveat (but it feels like a big one). What can I do to let her know that I generally feel disrespected and unappreciated? I have told her many times and she says \"oh sure I can be nicer\" but doesn't acknowledge the severity of it and then she doesn't change, which is particularly frustrating because I have changed a lot of things in my life for her.",

I know that she's taking SSRI medications at the moment for anxiety. But she was taking them before we broke up for couple weeks.

It catches on my thigh and dribbles down my leg, soaking the upper part of my pants.\n\nI had no spare pants, and had to walk around for four more hours after that, smelling like piss.  I wiped some liquid soap on it, hoping to mask the scent, and pulled my shirt down as far as possible.  Luckily, if anyone smelled anything, they'd just think it was the lady I was sitting and not me.",
    "97": "This is my first post ever on Reddit so please bear with me. \n\nA little backstory to begin, when I was a child my father bought 2.3 acres of property in a school district that he wanted us to attend in South Carolina. The hope was one day to build a house, however, as time passed that never materialized. We've owned the property for 20 years and over that time we've paid property taxes, sometimes late in the face of financial instability. Currently, we're doing better but still its an unnecessary financial burden and we'd like to capitalize on the property value having doubled since when we purchased, valued at $30,000 currently. We hired a realtor to sell the property a couple months ago but it has sat without much interest.  \n\nWe discovered our neighbors have been removing the for sale signs because they don't want someone to build on the wooded lot. We have left letters in the community's mailboxes detailing the problem. Without knowing which neighbor is doing it, we can't report them. Though the property is listed online, I'm pretty upset that there's not a on-site advertisement. In my frustration I was trying to think of alternatives while possibly irking the neighbors. I came up with an idea that actually was feasible and not too dramatic. We could either donate or sale the land for a reduced price and use it as a tax deduction; we considered Habitat for Humanity or Helping Hands. The problem, I know very little about about the tax deductions allowed/ how it would be applied. I read the full market value of the land is deductible but what does that mean in terms of tax refunds come next year? \n\nI want to do some good for the community; I have a BA in architecture and during college I was involved in community building and designed low income housing for those in need. My father has a similar sentiment but is business oriented and wants to reclaim his investment. I feel like this solution scratches both itches. Also, I would be lying if I didn't get some enjoyment at the prospect of inconveniencing the neighbors. Any ideas or information is welcome even if they aren't directly related to this idea. I just need advice on how to move the property with the maximum benefit for all (except those dick neighbors.)",
    "98": "I've been with her a little over a year. She's gorgeous, she's amazingly supportive. I love her. I'm 1000% sure of that. The problem is, I'm not sure I'm IN love with her. I love her SO much that I want to make sure I do what's best for her. I've hurt her a lot during our relationship without ever meaning to, simply because when we met, I was not with my ex anymore but still in love with my ex ( pronouns are hard with a lot of \"hers\", so I'll try to stick to \"her\" for my current girlfriend and use \"my ex\" otherwise). But I was very into her and tried to move on with her. But it's been, as I mentioned, a year and a half and I still am not entirely over my ex, to a degree I can't even hide. I just am sad a lot. Or I bring my ex up in conversation despite trying to remember not to (we were together for a long time, 7 years). And I know it hurts her. But the only alternative is to hide it, which feels extremely insincere. I can't even tell if it will ever get better or go away. How can I stop hurting her? I want to, but I don't feel like I can even trust my own healing process here. Is the only right thing to do to leave her and be alone and... just wait until I get back to neutral?\nI hate that my last relationship feels like it's poisoning my current one.",
    "99": "My boyfriend (18) and I (female 19) broke up about 3 and a half weeks ago. About two weeks ago I called him for closure and he told me that he had no interest in talking to me ever again. He was clearly very angry and said that he had moved on. We broke p because my parents caught us having sex and he felt very uncomfortable so he wanted out. I saw that he now follows his ex on twitter (his ex cheated on him btw) and she follows him. Why would he do that? \n\nHe had told me before we broke up that he was madly in love with me and that he wouldn't know what to do without me. It was obvious that we both cared a lot about each other, so I don't understand why he wants no contact. Should I reach out to him?"

The damage on my car is on the passanger's side (behind the front wheel but in front of the side mirror) & the damage on his car is on his left bumper. \n\nThere was no police report and the guy is apparently claiming that I was trying to make a left turn on an intersection when he hit me..?  Apparently he has an attorney & I'm not sure if I should get a lawyer also. His son called me today & asked me to re-email him the insurance information because the information I gave him was apparently wrong. However, I talked to my insurance and they had already talked to the guy's insurance company so I'm not sure if he's lying or not. He also wants me to send me pictures of my car's damages because his father didn't take pictures of the damages. I know I shouldn't agree to that but is it safe to even send him the insurance information when it seems that our insurances are already talking?\n\nTL;DR:",

She's got nothing to do that occupies her time aside from watching TV. She's been doing more reading lately, even had me pick her up a booklight so should could read while my dad is asleep, but she's reading stuff that's clearly not intellectually challenging.

Two days later, Trish has deleted her facebook account and created a new one.

He basically said \"chill out.

The only way I can contact her is through the new facebook account--which I'm sure Frank monitors. I know Trish lives with Frank and his family in the foreign country--and I don't know that she has enough to move out.

It would be ok if I could see her to tell her it'll be ok, but I really don't know what I can really say texting trying to make her feel comfortable.\n\nAlso, since we started talking, messaging has been pretty consistent. But in the days leading up to the competition, she's been kind of short and dispersed with her communication. I've been giving her space and not texting because I know she's busy, and she's been starting conversations at night. Even though I know she's unbelievably busy, I can't help but feel she is being a little distant. \n\n---\n\nSo tonight is her big night. What the hell can I text her if she tells me she totally bombed her routine? \n\nAlso, do you think the distance could be because she's possibly losing interest? Or am I just paranoid haha. We have a date Monday after she's done everything, I plan on casually asking her about why she was being a little distant when we go out.\n\nTL;DR:",

We had moved from another city so this would be her second appt. at this groomer. It had been a year since her last appointment because my family and I decided to groom her ourselves. She was happy and excited when we got there and pee'd a little when the groomer examined her. When we came back to pick her up, the groomer said that was aggressive all throughout and tried to bite her several times. They eventually put a dog muzzle on her. My mom and I were so surprised by this because she has NEVER showed any aggression towards a human or towards any of her previous groomers. In fact, she loves being cuddled by other people and goes to people whenever we're at a dog park. \n\nWhat do you guys think went wrong and what could I do for the next appointment?\nAt first I thought it was because of her matted fur. The groomer shot this theory down and said that my dog was aggressive even after getting the matted hair out.  She has also been a lot more matted before (the very first time when she was a puppy) and had never had aggression issues. Or could it be that she was gone for the groomers for too long and didn't feel comfortable in a relatively new environment with a different groomer? Or could it also be the groomer herself, and that my dog just didn't like her? The previous groomer didn't have any issues. \n\nWhat should I do the next time we go to the groomers? It will be a new groomer again and I hope she doesn't lash out. Will she be able to feel comfortable again? I'm scared that if she becomes too aggressive, no one will take her... :(\n\nTL;DR:",

I usually don't post much but this is a big problem for me and I would like to get more points of view, information regarding the situation, and any possible courses of action I could take to help.\n\nFirst off, I would like to say I love reading both this subreddit and r/longdistance. I love seeing how supportive you guys are and it restores my faith in people quite often.  I like reading both subreddits when I'm upset.\n\nMy girlfriend, lets call her Samantha, has a lot of issues with her home life.  Her mom is bipolar and quite frankly nuts, she has these episodes where she physicially abuses Samantha and her younger siblings that live with her.  She has gone as far as throwing razor blades and glass objects at her.  Samantha does everything she can to make her mom calm down, but sometimes this is just met with even more violence.  Her mother will hit the younger kids as well and Samantha does her best to protect them and stand up for them.  \n\nEven when she isn't going through an episode like this, Samantha's mother doesn't treat her well in any respect.  She gives her the responsibilities of an adult, yet treats her like a child.  Samantha has 2 facebook accounts, the initial reason being that her mother wouldn't let her talk to her dad and his side of the family, but now she uses it a lot to talk to my mom and I.  Her mother knows the account information for her original one and goes on there and reads her conversations and such.  She does everything she can to control every aspect of Samantha's life.  It seems like she's even trying to break us up, but I doubt that's going to work out for her.\n\nMy mom told her that we would all come up with something together to do to help her, but I honestly don't know what kind of a solution could be presented.

He was married again within 1-2 years.  They speak very rarely.\n\nThe issue is this: she is very depressed and can't move on with her life.  She's relatively functional in her professional life, but she's made it clear she misses having someone to talk to the way that she talked to my dad (both are very smart people, and she has a hard time getting that with her friendships and colleagues).  She has a tendency to drink too much and I catch her with 'bummed' cigarettes.  She's made a few attempts at online dating, but has always found her dates to be dull or socially inept or uninteresting.  Personally, I think the problem stems from the fact that she has been with my father since she was 19 and therefore never had to develop dating skills...she's probably shy and would rather avoid it.  Not to mention that exuding unhappiness makes you a pretty dull date!\n\nI'm worried because I'm moving to a different state soon and I want her to be on an upswing before I leave.

He's sweet, caring, tolerant, liberal, basically every single thing on my 'checklist', if I had one, is there. \n\nThe problem, though, is he talks VERY slowly. I mean his speed is really slow. If I ask him anything, he takes about 3 seconds before he starts to talk, then when he starts, the words go at a very slow pace,and he even pauses for 3-5 seconds in the middle of his sentence. I get really impatient and sometimes just feel like telling him to hurry up (of course I don't, but I really feel like doing so). \n\nI asked him today, very gently, why he spoke so slow, and he said he just gets thoughts very slowly in his brain. He then went on to say he's just generally slow at thinking. I felt really sad when he said this, I don't know why. He's a Math PhD student,and we are at a pretty good school, and his research has been going slow for a while now (but this is totally normal in grad school), so I think that response was kind of a self-deprecating one since he's already low on self-esteem. \n\nAnyway, my point is, his speed of talking is just a part of him, it can't be changed. I love him so much otherwise but I just want to know how to deal with this. Conversation is so important in a relationship! How do we manage?

I made some half-hearted attempts at making friends when Uni started up in March this year, and since then, but I just don't have any idea how to go about it. I'm kind of thinking I've missed the bus now, since everyone seems to have friends and I have no idea how to inject myself into an existing group of friends. There's a couple of people that I was in a group with on O-week, who I talk to occasionally, but I don't know how to make the next step there, either.\n\nTL;DR:",

I told him that we had kissed on the dance floor last year and he barely remembered it, which I don't have a problem with. \n\nBasically, my first kiss was not that significant emotionally (but it was pretty good), but the fact that I'm dating the guy I had my first kiss with is...interesting. It wasn't his first kiss. He's my first boyfriend; I'm not his first girlfriend. Also, he's the first (and only) person I've had sex with, while I'm not the first person he's had sex with.\n\nShould I tell him that he was my first kiss? Would he find it a funny coincidence, or be a little weirded out that he's been my \"first\" for all these things? I don't want him to think I'm super clingy or that I planned this all out or something. It's true that I was a little extra interested in him the second time we met because of our past encounter, but that definitely didn't become the basis of my attraction to him. \n\nI'm debating between not telling him at all, or waiting until we've known each other for longer. The topic of first kisses may come up at some point before then, though.\n\nTL;DR:",

After a while we got close, I would walk her to classes and she would give me a hug every time i walk her, but after a while she stopped talking to me because some guy made a move on her. So apparently she was in-between me and this other guy at the time. She picked him, over me even though i would walk her to classes, even ditch one to see her this one time, but in the end he won. She started to not reply to my messages even though i made it clear to her that I would want us to be just friends. A while later, i went to start another convo on facebook with her, and it had appeared that i couldn't reply to her anymore, nor could I view her profile. I had found out she had blocked me. I'm assuming her new bf told her to block me on all social medias because he probably saw our previous messages, why i assume this is because we had talked before and whenever I would bring up the girl he would make an angry facial expression and also because he had also blocked me. So after I found out I was complaining to a best friend about this and he messaged the girl about how she had me blocked and she said \"I didn't know\". So fast forward till this day and she still has me blocked even after my friend confronted her. Well I guess I'm not going to talk to her anytime soon.\n\nTL;DR:",

Within a week. I currently work for a bank that requires strict sales goals to meet. IF they aren't met three times (three months) you're canned. They pay me 10/hour and it's not unheard of to get a raise in 6ish months. The issue is, **I'm not a salesperson**. That's not my personality. I'm amazing at customer service, I have the most positive customer service \"reports\" done about me in the short time I've worked here. A coworker asked \"do you ask for people to fill these out? you have a ton\". That being said, I have a job opportunity at Chase Bank as a part time teller. What makes this decision so hard is that at my current job, I get 40 hours and Chase could only offer me 20 hours/week. Drive time to my current job is also 21 miles **one way** while Chase is literally 1.8 miles from my house, allowing me to go home for lunch. I do have an apartment and an awesome roommate that I know wont be late on his portion of rent, so paying bills with 20hours a week isn't the issue. It's the spending money and being broke all the time.\n\nI previously worked at Wal-Mart and took home just about 400 dollars every other week. So I know i can survive on this income. I just don't know whether I should go for Chase as I could definitely see myself having a career there. I'm a math major likely going to become an actuary, so Chase could provide excellent opportunities for me **eventually**.\n\nTL;DR:",

There's a reference librarian who works there, and I've had the massive hots for him since day one. He ticks a lot of boxes for me - tallish, sandy-haired, soft-spoken, well-dressed, good-looking in a flawed, accessible way. Plus, you know, he's a librarian, which is sexy.

I'm usually not good at cold approaches. I have a reasonable amount confidence in my ability to talk to strangers comfortably/engagingly, but I'm also introverted and neurotic and often don't have any idea how to go from Interest to Interaction.

I'm just a little stuck in this particular situation. Partly because ...\n\n2. I'm hesitant to approach people while they're on the clock. I've worked my fair share of jobs in which I was required to interact with the public, and I always hated it when a customer would try to pitch woo at me - the pressure to be polite is enormous, even if you're cringing inside. I'm not saying I'm gonna start pelvic thrusting at this guy while he's trapped behind his desk until he starts crying; I'd just like to talk to him a bit while also being sensitive to the fact that he might not welcome flirty interaction while he's working.\n\nPeople who are wiser and more well-adjusted than I, please advise.

It threw everyone of a loop, but it was nothing dramatic.  My family is mostly Southern Baptist, so they don't agree with homosexuality, but no one ever says anything to me.

So, my parents aren't really reminded that I'm gay.\n\nHowever, when anyone brings up a topic about gay rights or marriage, I get very uncomfortable.  For instance last night when there was a story on the news about Romeny talking about gay marriage at the graduation ceremony.  I was going crazy inside.  I didn't know how to feel or what to think.   I was petrified until the story was over.  No one said anything.

I can't remember the times I wasn't with her. I don't have a memory which doesn't include her.\n\nI was never comfortable around people, and only with her I was relaxed, I could talk comfortably only with her, and we always said that we won't leave each ever. I was very happy.\n\nAnd things start to get bad. I couldn't met her expectations. She got depressed, and I couldn't help her; I couldn't find correct words to say to her, and I couldn't make her happy. After the treatment for her depression, she (correctly) left me, and blocked me everywhere except one messaging service.\n\nAfter that, I was just making myself believe that she'll be back, we'll be together and happy again. But she clearly isn't. Recently she told me that she's with someone else, he loves her very much etc. \n\nAnd there's me now. My only memories are with her, I don't talk with anyone except my coworkers. I don't feel *anything* since she left me, I'm not sad, I just don't want anything. I have a job and working for M.S degree, and I just *continue* them, without doing anything for my life. Every day I think about her for a few minutes, and I just feel angry, I don't know why.\n\nShe isn't returning, she made it pretty clear. But it left me in a pretty bad situation, without anyone to help. This is the first time I'm saying these.\n\nActually I don't know what I'm trying to achieve with this post. Maybe writing about it helps.\n\nHave a nice day everyone.\n\nTL;DR:",

Former dumped me in Sept, the latter entered a FWB relationship, and the former wants back in.\n\nText: In September my boyfriend of 10 months (Bart) broke up with me. We had been fighting almost all summer and it was a long, heartbreaking process. For the last month he insisted he didn't need to say \"I love you\" and we almost never had sex. Awful. \n\nAbout a month later my ex (Steve) from less than an hour away just dumped his ex and we entered a sort of FWB situation. We had been there before because we have excellent sexual chemistry, but the romance wasn't there for YEARS. Now, after a month, the first ex (Bart) and I exchanged letters and we agreed to a friendship, he started going to the gym with me and it was a really good. We both achieved long-sought goals of physical fitness and he was a good motivator. The past two weeks he's been getting cozier. Four days ago he came over and we finally kissed again and we had a loooong talk. I explained that telling somebody you don't love them, and wont have sex with them, isn't a real relationship. He had many many emotional outbursts in the past, which I explained were totally unacceptable. \n\nThen he pulled what feels like a high school girl move and opened up about a dark secret (long story is he was taken advantage of by a Sugar Daddy who helped pay for college expenses and it had repercussions that manifested as intimacy issues). I told him I didn't really give a shit about it. I also told him that I'd be open to another attempt at a relationship but I wont call him my boyfriend or partner until \"It damn well feels like it\". Maybe that wasn't fair of me. \n\nSo here I am, between two boys. The FWB (Steve) needs to be made aware because we established an exclusive sexual relationship for health reasons. I dunno if I want to go back to an emotionally immature, possibly sexless relationship. Oh and all three of us aren't financially independent because student loans lol\n\nTL;DR:",

I have no first hand experience.\n\nI broke up with my girlfriend stating very plainly that although I still loved her very much, I couldn't see a future for us and I didn't want to prolong our relationship because every passing day will only make the inevitable separation that much worse.\n\nShe's a romantic, and told me during the breakup that while she wasn't going to stop me, she believed that there is only one special person for every person out there, and I was that for her. I know this is probably her youth talking, but knowing her, she takes the stuff she says way more seriously than the average girl. \n\nI'm afraid she'll take it very hard and her process of recovery will be much longer than it should be. Hell, I'm afraid she might never actually let this go. I don't know.\n\nI feel extremely guilty because she's begged me to come back since, and I told her a straight out no, because I didn't think the relationship would last long after this. It's only been a few days, and I'd say I've made significant progress recovering (it's been very tough though), but she hasn't turned up to school or spoken to many people. She only confided in a couple of friends and bawled her eyes out at them.\n\nMy friends told me that most breakups are one-sided anyway and it was inevitable that I'd be the asshole in the situation. But that's not really what I care about. How do I handle this? She still very much expects that somehow sometime I'll be running back to her. I've made my decision and I'm adamant that I won't, so how do I help her find \"closure\" without destroying her completely?\n\nTL;DR:",

It was extremely loud and had a Pop-ing sound So I droped the shovel and what I was doing and jumped over the walls seprateing the pens then sprinted out the back door onto a trail. After I got out far enough I called my Father warning him not to go the the Agriculture area. After the trail ended at a no trespassing sign I ran through bushes and branches getting scraped up until I reached the clearing where I ran down to the schools office. The first thing they notice is im shaking, sweating, and stuttering like a motherfucker and asked what happend. I reported the incident and someone went up to check it out. Turns out what happend was one of the older boys that were up there was angry and he has some issues so he grabed a pig cane and smashed it against the building twice breaking it. It takes alot of force to break one of those or even dent a building which lead me to belive it was a gun shot.

Looking for advice\n\nText: Thank you in advance for anyone taking the time to read/reply to this. Last August, I (29M) started working full time after a LONG period of unemployment. Before that I worked freelance as a graphic/web designer and photographer but it wasn't enough to make a decent living. I own professional equipment and have 5 weddings under my belt, but my biggest problem is self-promotion and advertising (I'm not the most confident person when it comes to selling myself). At this new job, I'm working 40+ hours a week making $15/hr. The job is related to my field (graphic design), but it's not a creative position. I'm basically pumping out orders for this company based off of templates. The first few months were okay since I was learning new techniques and a new program, but now I feel like a robot and this place is sucking the life/energy out of me. There is no sick time, no personal time, the building itself is not well-maintained, and there is nowhere to move up in the company. The only thing keeping me going is the idea that it's not permanent. My plan was to make it a year at this place, save some money, and figure out the rest when the time came. I live with my SO and am lucky to have very low expenses (<$500/mo) I've managed to save around 15k in the time I've been there. I miss the freedom that came with freelance work, but having a steady paycheck is certainly nice. It's very tough to find a job in my area, so on one hand I feel lucky to be in the situation I'm in, but on the other I feel like I can do much better.\n\nTL;DR:",

Her exact words were \"Fuck you, have a good life.\"\n\n I feel horrible about this whole thing, we haven't had the HEALTHIEST relationship, but it's still one I never wanted to end.

Bad friendships, new dog, kicking a housemate out for her. After every tense situation, I am the one apologizing and I understand I haven't handled things exactly as she wanted, but it worries me how few mistakes she has admitted and how empathetic she is not. I read recently that people who love you are by your side even when you suck. I feel that is the only time when we are not close. Like the success of this relationship depends on my ability to make x number of mistakes or fewer. Shouldn't it be more about understanding each others' intentions and avoiding offending each other, while forgiving mistakes? I feel that she has never really forgiven me. Each time I apologize she accepts it as if I said \"it won't happen again\" instead of accepting it because it was an honest miscommunication or mistake. Similarly, she rarely apologizes because she is who she is. I'll admit that she makes very few mistakes but the ones she makes are very personal like not paying attention to me when I am sad or not acknowledging the legitimacy of my feelings. She is an affectionate person but only on her own time. There are very specific occasions that people need a hug or a shoulder and she does not look for ways to console me in those times, despite my requests that she be more attentive. I do not want to leave her but I will if need be. We are very compatible, save for this caveat (but it feels like a big one). What can I do to let her know that I generally feel disrespected and unappreciated? I have told her many times and she says \"oh sure I can be nicer\" but doesn't acknowledge the severity of it and then she doesn't change, which is particularly frustrating because I have changed a lot of things in my life for her.\n\nTL;DR:",

How will this help my tax returns?\n\nText: This is my first post ever on Reddit so please bear with me. \n\nA little backstory to begin, when I was a child my father bought 2.3 acres of property in a school district that he wanted us to attend in South Carolina. The hope was one day to build a house, however, as time passed that never materialized. We've owned the property for 20 years and over that time we've paid property taxes, sometimes late in the face of financial instability. Currently, we're doing better but still its an unnecessary financial burden and we'd like to capitalize on the property value having doubled since when we purchased, valued at $30,000 currently. We hired a realtor to sell the property a couple months ago but it has sat without much interest.  \n\nWe discovered our neighbors have been removing the for sale signs because they don't want someone to build on the wooded lot. We have left letters in the community's mailboxes detailing the problem. Without knowing which neighbor is doing it, we can't report them. Though the property is listed online, I'm pretty upset that there's not a on-site advertisement. In my frustration I was trying to think of alternatives while possibly irking the neighbors. I came up with an idea that actually was feasible and not too dramatic. We could either donate or sale the land for a reduced price and use it as a tax deduction; we considered Habitat for Humanity or Helping Hands. The problem, I know very little about about the tax deductions allowed/ how it would be applied. I read the full market value of the land is deductible but what does that mean in terms of tax refunds come next year? \n\nI want to do some good for the community; I have a BA in architecture and during college I was involved in community building and designed low income housing for those in need. My father has a similar sentiment but is business oriented and wants to reclaim his investment. I feel like this solution scratches both itches. Also, I would be lying if I didn't get some enjoyment at the prospect of inconveniencing the neighbors. Any ideas or information is welcome even if they aren't directly related to this idea. I just need advice on how to move the property with the maximum benefit for all (except those dick neighbors.)\n\nTL;DR:",

She's gorgeous, she's amazingly supportive. I love her. I'm 1000% sure of that. The problem is, I'm not sure I'm IN love with her. I love her SO much that I want to make sure I do what's best for her. I've hurt her a lot during our relationship without ever meaning to, simply because when we met, I was not with my ex anymore but still in love with my ex ( pronouns are hard with a lot of \"hers\", so I'll try to stick to \"her\" for my current girlfriend and use \"my ex\" otherwise). But I was very into her and tried to move on with her. But it's been, as I mentioned, a year and a half and I still am not entirely over my ex, to a degree I can't even hide. I just am sad a lot. Or I bring my ex up in conversation despite trying to remember not to (we were together for a long time, 7 years). And I know it hurts her. But the only alternative is to hide it, which feels extremely insincere. I can't even tell if it will ever get better or go away. How can I stop hurting her? I want to, but I don't feel like I can even trust my own healing process here. Is the only right thing to do to leave her and be alone and... just wait until I get back to neutral?\nI hate that my last relationship feels like it's poisoning my current one.\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm very confused.\n\nText: My boyfriend (18) and I (female 19) broke up about 3 and a half weeks ago. About two weeks ago I called him for closure and he told me that he had no interest in talking to me ever again. He was clearly very angry and said that he had moved on. We broke p because my parents caught us having sex and he felt very uncomfortable so he wanted out. I saw that he now follows his ex on twitter (his ex cheated on him btw) and she follows him. Why would he do that? \n\nHe had told me before we broke up that he was madly in love with me and that he wouldn't know what to do without me. It was obvious that we both cared a lot about each other, so I don't understand why he wants no contact. Should I reach out to him?\n\nTL;DR:"
